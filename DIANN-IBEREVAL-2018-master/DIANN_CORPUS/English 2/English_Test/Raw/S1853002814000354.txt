Abstract
 Lately, there have been a few studies warning about an increased risk of sudden death in patients with Parkinson's disease.
We report two men with Parkinson's disease with a disease duration of more than ten years.
In the first case, the subject was treated with L-dopa/carbidopa/entacapone, rasagiline, and amantadine.
The second subject was treated with L-dopa/carbidopa, piribedil, and amantadine (in this case we had to perform an autopsy).
We discuss the causes of this phenomenon: sympathetic cardioselective neuronal degeneration, parasympathetic dysautonomia, and QTc interval prolongation by antiparkinsonian drugs.
Practical approaches are suggested for monitoring this group of patients until more data about the origin of this phenomenon is available.
