Abstract
 Introduction
In our environment, cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in children.
The people with CP have problems with muscle tone and that cause musculoskeletal deformities and postural and balance disorders.
Physiotherapy is required from birth.
The main objective of this study is to improve psychomotor development of children with CP using video games in physical therapy treatment.
Patients and methods
A longitudinal, prospective experimental pretest posttest design type with one group.
Participants were 8 patients with CP aged between 6 and 12, I-II level in GMFCS and score between 75%-100% in GMFM-88.
Physiotherapy intervention uses the Nintendo Wii console and the Wii-fit balance board game for 15 sessions.
Balance (Berg scale), location load-distribution center of gravity (with the software of the balance board), and motivation in physical therapy sessions (measured by an ad-hoc scale) were studied.
The study was conducted during the 2013-2014 school year in the physiotherapy room of a school.
Results
This study shows statistically significant evidence supporting the improvement in balance, in patient satisfaction and more adequate distribution in the load of the lower limbs.
Discussion and conclusions
Virtual reality helps in achieving different objectives of physiotherapy, with interesting use to improve balance and postural control.
The results support the use of the Wii console as a complement, never a substitute, the child with PCI physiotherapist treatment.
