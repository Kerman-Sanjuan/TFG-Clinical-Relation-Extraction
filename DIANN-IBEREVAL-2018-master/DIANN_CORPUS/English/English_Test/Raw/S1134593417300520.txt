Abstract
 Cognitive dysfunction in major depressive disorder (MDD) spans multiple domains, including–but not limited to–executive function, verbal memory and attention.
Moreover, cognitive dysfunction is a common residual manifestation in depression and may persist during the remission phase of affective and somatic symptoms.
Cognitive deficits can also prevent functional recovery, including the ability to work, and social and familar recovery.
New antidepressants such as Vortioxetine seem to achieve a significant improvement in the cognitive domains that are altered in MDD, thus providing additional benefits over conventional and selective antidepressants.
The general objectives of this article are to critically assess the effects of available antidepressants and to discuss new therapeutic targets on neurocognitive dysfunction in MDD.
