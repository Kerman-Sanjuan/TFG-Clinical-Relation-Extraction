Abstract
 Introduction and objectives
The purpose of the episodic memory test and the caregiver's episodic memory test is to evaluate episodic memory according to its definition in a way that is feasible for families and achieves high degrees of sensitivity and specificity.
Methods and results
We administered a test consisting of 10 questions about episodic events to 332 subjects, of whom 65 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), 115 had amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 152 showed no cognitive impairment according to Reisberg's global deterioration scale (GDS).
We calculated the test's sensitivity and specificity to distinguish AD from episodic aMCI and from normal ageing.
The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of aMCI was 0.94 and the best cut- off value was 20; for that value, sensitivity was 89% and specificity was 82%.
For a diagnosis of AD, the area under the ROC curve was 0.99 and the best cut- off point was 17, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 91%.
A subsequent study using similar methodology yielded similar results when the test was administered directly by the caregiver.
Conclusions
The episodic memory test and the caregiver's episodic memory test are useful as brief screening tools for identifying patients with early-stage AD.
It is suitable for use by primary care medical staff and in the home, since it can be administered by a caregiver.
The test's limitations are that it must be administered by a reliable caregiver and the fact that it measures episodic memory only.
