Abstract
 Objective
Alzheimer's disease has been studied from various areas of knowledge (biomarkers, brain structure, behavior, cognitive impairment).
Our aim was to examine the effects of an exercises protocol developed using complexity theory concepts.
Method
Exercise improves neuroplasticity (neuronal ability to change and adapt as a result of experience) through mental and physical skills linked to cognitive- associative brain circuits.
Introducing controlled physical and cognitive stimuli, self-organization and connectivity among brain systems enhance.
We used tasks with non-linear outputs (several solutions) and learning as order parameter.
Tasks were performed simultaneously, at the edge of the error seeking self-organized criticality.
Results
Screening tests data showed a reduction in cognitive impairment, which suggests a reduction disease progression, in terms of executive function.
There was a marked improvement in the physical tests: 30 seconds chair stand test (PRE: 8.78 ± 3.46; POST: 9.44 ± 3.68 repetitions) and foot up and go test (PRE: 11.95 ± 5.19; POST: 11.69 ± 4.43 seconds).
Conclusion
Results showed that patient's self-organization was increased; behaviors atrophied or inhibited reappeared.
Using these controlled perturbations, Alzheimer's Disease patients were able to manifest improvements in both their mental and physical abilities.
