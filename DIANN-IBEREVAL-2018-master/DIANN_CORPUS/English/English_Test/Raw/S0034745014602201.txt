Abstract
 Background
Previous studies with neuropsychological testing have shown deficits in working memory in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).
It is not yet clear if there is correlation with functional activation in neuroimaging such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
Objective
To describe a new paradigm of neurocognitive assessment to identify the possible differences in the characteristics of neurofunctional response in patients with BD using a working memory task.
Methods
Descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study.
We evaluated 12 euthymic patients with BD-I (in treatment with lithium or valproate or without treatment at least 2 months prior to the study) and 4 participants with no psychiatric disorder.
fMRI was used to correlate their operative memory processes with the changes seen in the BOLD signal using a paradigm that combines the presentation of blocks and related events.
Results
Control's brain activation was greater during response condition compared with bipolar patients.
When comparing between patient groups there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05).
_Discussion:_ The paradigm we deployed is useful to study activation in brain areas involved in working memory processes.
The results with bipolar patients need to be expanded with larger populations to compare other possible cognitive deficits and medication specific effects.
