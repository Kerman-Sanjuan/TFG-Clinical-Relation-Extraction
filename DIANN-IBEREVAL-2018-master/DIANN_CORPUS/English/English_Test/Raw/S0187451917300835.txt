Case report
This is a 19-year-old male with bilateral external rectus muscle palsy secundary to trauma. 
During treatment, an inadvertent intraocular injection of botulinum toxin was present, causing a retinal tear and localized retinal detachment. 
Both lesions were delimited with laser observing a spontaneous resolution of the detachment without presenting visual impairment during the follow-up.
Discussion
Although intraocular botulinum toxin does not generate retinal toxicity, inadvertent intraocular injection should be closely monitored to avoid complications secondary to perforation.
