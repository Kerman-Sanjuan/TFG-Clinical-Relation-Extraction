Abstract
We report a retrospective study of 20 cases of acute epiglottitis in adults admited at our hospital between 1991 and 2001.
Wegather a series of variables: Patient sex, age, year and month of admission, personal history, initial clinical symptoms, complementary tests asked, given treatment, evolution and hospital average stay.
Wefound an obvious predominance in male (19:1 with respect to female), with an average age of 45 years.
Themain symtomps were <dis>dysphagia-odynophagia</dis> (85%), followed by fever (55%) and pharyngocervical pain.
Dyspneawas confirmed in 9 of 20 patients (45%); 5 of them required airway control with the help of intubation in one case, urgent coniotomy in three cases and tracheotomy in another one.
Apatient suffered from an acute mediastinitis and required assistance and medical IV extended treatment in UCI.
Weshow a case of another patient who suffered sudden cardiorespiratory arrest a followed by death.
Hedid not present previus dyspnea.
Acuteepiglottitis in adults is a rare pathology with a good prognosis in general, but may lead to an unpredictable and serious complication even in the absence of airway blockage.
Wecarry out a medical literature review in this respect.Abstract
Innineteen seventy two Townes and Brocks reported on a family in which the father and seven children showed anal atresia, triphalangeal thumb, metatarsal synostosis, extra fingers, <dis>neurosensorial deafness</dis> and ear abnormalities.
Themain traits were those related to hand, ear and anus alterations, transmited under a dominant autosomal pattern.
Inthis paper we present several members of the same family with similar alterations who finally were diagnosed of Townes-Brocks syndrome.Background.
Retinopathyof prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease caused by an alteration in retinal vasculogenesis that may lead to <dis>partial or complete vision loss</dis> with a harmful impact in terms of neurodevelopment. 
Thepurpose of the present study was to determine the neurodevelopment in patients with type i retinopathy of prematurity treated with intravitreal bevacizumab.

Materialand methods.
Caseseries. 
Theinclusion criteria were: patients with type I ROP treated with a dose of 0.625mg/0.025ml of intravitreal bevacizumab. 
Demographicdata and comorbidities were documented. 
Neurodevelopmentwas evaluated with the screening test of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID) in all patients between 11 and 28 weeks of age.

Results.
Sevenpatients were included in the study. 
Fourpatients showed normal neurodevelopment according to the overall scores of the BSID scale. 
Thedistribution of high risk for neurodevelopmental delay in the different areas evaluated were as follows: 3 patients presented it in the cognitive area, one in the receptive communication area, one in the expressive area, one in the fine motor skills and 3 patients in the gross motor skills area.

Conclusions.
Inthese case series, the majority of patients treated with intravitreal bevacizumab for ROP showed normal neurodevelopment scores.
Growingbasic research in recent years led to the discovery of the endocannabinoid system with a central role in neurobiology.
Newevidence suggests a therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in cancer chemotherapy- induced nausea and vomiting as well as in pain, spasticity and other symptoms in multiple sclerosis and <dis>movement disorders</dis>.
Resultsof large randomized clinical trials of oral and sublingual _Cannabis_ extracts will be known soon and there will be definitive answers to whether _Cannabis_ has any therapeutic potential.
Althoughthe immediate future may lie in plant-based medicines, new targets for cannabinoid therapy focuses on the development of endocannabinoid degradation inhibitors which may offer site selectivity not afforded by cannabinoid receptor agonists.Usher syndrome includes hereditary pathologies characterized by <dis>bilateral sensorineural deafness</dis> and <dis>visual impairment</dis> due to retinitis pigmentosa.
Clinically,there are three distinct subtypes referred to as USH1, USH2, and USH3.
Eachsubtype is genetically heterogeneous.
Elevendifferent genes are implicated in the pathology; most of them are also implicated in isolated auditory or visual pathologies.
MYO7Ais responsible of 75% of the USH1 cases and Usherin is responsible of 82% of USH2A patients.
Theproteins have direct interactions with each other, are expressed in cochlea and retina and perform an essential role in stereocilia homeostasis.
From1995 we approach the study of Usher syndrome in Spain from different points of view: epidemiological, clinic, genetic and molecular.
Thisstudy will provide additional insight into the pathogenic process involved in Usher syndrome, prognosis factors, and guide to the search for targeted therapies.A large number of mutations and polymorphisms associated with neurodegenerative disorders have been described during the last years.
Thesefindings have been helpful to improve our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these disorders.
Inthis review we describe the genetic alterations and variants that cause or predispose to develop several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, <dis>frontotemporal dementia</dis>, Parkinson’s disease and other parkinsonisms.
Wealso comment on the possible pathogenic mechanism of these mutations, clinical features and the usefulness of this information for the diagnosis and management of these disorders.Essential tremor is the most common adult <dis>movement disorder</dis>.
Traditionallyconsidered as a benign disease, it can cause an important <dis>physical and psychosocial disability</dis>.
Drugtreatment remains poor and often unsatisfactory.
Currenttherapeutical strategies are reviewed according to the level of discomfort caused by tremor: mild tremor, non-pharmacological strategies, alcohol, acute pharmacological therapy; moderate tremor, pharmacological therapies (propranolol, gabapentin, primidone, topiramate, alprazolam and other drugs), and severe tremor, the role of functional surgery is emphasized (thalamic deep brain stimulation, thalamotomy).
Itis also described the more specific treatment of head tremor with the use botulinum toxin.
Finally,several points are exposed to guide the immediate research of this disease in near future.Abstract
Background and objective
Toanalyze the role of depression in <dis>cognitive deficits</dis> of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
Patientsand methods
57women with CFS were assessed by neuropsychological tests that included measures of attention: CalCap, Mental control of the WMS-III, PASAT, forward and backward digits (WAIS-III), symbol digit modalities test (SDMT); executive functions: Stroop Test, Trail Making Test (TMT A y B) _ **,**_ FAS, Tower of London; memory: Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (AVL), Rey Complex Figure (RCF), and psychomotor skills: Grooved Pegboard.
Theraw scores on the tests were adjusted according to normative data and transformed to T scores.
Thesample was divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of depression, assessed by clinical interview and administration of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Thisstudy compared neuropsychological test scores between the two groups.
Results
CFSpatients showed <dis>cognitive deficit in attention and executive functions</dis>, regardless of the presence of depression.
Therewere no significant differences between the two CFS groups.
Conclusions
The<dis>cognitive impairments</dis> in patients with CFS are not secondary to the presence of depression.
Theseresults should be taken into account in the implementation of therapeutic programs in these patients.Abstract
Background and objective
Leberhereditary optic neuropathy is characterized by <dis>acute and subacute visual loss</dis>, produced by mitochondrial DNA mutations.
Patientsand methods
Themolecular study of a family with only one affected member is presented.
Results
Inthe index case and in her mother, the mitochondrial mutation m.11778G>A in the _MT-ND4_ was detected in the heteroplasmic state.
Theindex case's sister, without ocular manifestations, asked for genetic counseling.
Thestudy of the mentioned mutation by Sanger sequencing identified it in an apparent homoplasmic state.
However,by means of next-generation sequencing (NGS), the mutation was actually in a heteroplasmic state.
Conclusions
Regardinggenetic counseling, verifying a mutation in homoplasmic state is really important.
Wehave observed that NGS allows us to discriminate between high levels of heteroplasmy and homoplasmy, meaning that it is a useful technique for the analysis of apparent homoplasmic results obtained with less sensitive technique, as Sanger sequencing.Abstract
Introduction
The22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is associated with the microdeletion of this chromosomal region, and represents the second most common genetic syndrome after Down's syndrome.
Inpatients with schizophrenia, 22q11.2 DS has a prevalence of 2%, and in selected groups can be increased to between 32-53%.
Objective
Todescribe the generalities of 22q11.2 DS syndrome as a genetic subtype of schizophrenia, its clinical characteristics, molecular genetic aspects, and frequency in different populations.
Methods
Areview was performed from 1967 to 2013 in scientific databases, compiling articles about 22q11.2 DS syndrome and its association with schizophrenia.
Results
The22q11.2 DS syndrome has a variable phenotype associated with other genetic syndromes, birth defects in many tissues and organs, and a high rate of <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis>, particularly schizophrenia.
Likewise,it has been identified in clinical populations with schizophrenia selected by the presence of common syndromic characteristics.
FISH,qPCR and MLPA techniques, and recently, aCGH and NGS technologies, are being used to diagnose this microdeletion.
Conclusions
Itis important in clinical practice to remember that people suffering the 22q11.2 DS have a high genetic risk for developing schizophrenia, and it is considered that the simultaneous presence of this disease and 22q11.2 DS represents a genetic subtype of schizophrenia.
Thereare clear phenotypic criteria, molecular and cytogenetic methods to diagnose this group of patients, and to optimize a multidisciplinary approach in their monitoring.Abstract
Background
Largescale neuropsychological studies of patients with bipolar disorder have reported <dis>verbal memory and executive function deficits</dis> that persist during remission.
Arecent analysis by Thompson et al. (2009) indicated that <dis>verbal memory deficits</dis> could be entirely explained by the statistical variance attributed to <dis>primary executive function deficits</dis>.
Thisstudy tests the hypothesis that <dis>verbal memory deficits</dis> in bipolar patients are largely the result of <dis>executive difficulties</dis> by direct comparison of verbal neuropsychological tests primarily differing in their executive load as well as examining potential interactions with medication status.
Methods
33Bipolar I patients not taking medication, 40 Bipolar I patients taking medication, and 28 healthy controls were compared on measures of IQ, verbal fluency, category fluency, verbal recall, and category prompted recall.
Results
Aftercontrolling for IQ, performance on tasks that involved additional executive involvement was significantly worse.
Medicationhad a small but reliable effect on cognitive performance.
Conclusions
Theresults provide support to the hypothesis that the most significant source of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in bipolar disorder stems from <dis>executive impairment</dis> and that <dis>verbal memory deficits</dis> may arise as a result of this, rather than from <dis>primary impairment to core verbal memory mechanisms</dis>.
Abstract
Background
Previousstudies with neuropsychological testing have shown <dis>deficits in working memory</dis> in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).
Itis not yet clear if there is correlation with functional activation in neuroimaging such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
Objective
Todescribe a new paradigm of neurocognitive assessment to identify the possible differences in the characteristics of neurofunctional response in patients with BD using a working memory task.
Methods
Descriptive,correlational, cross-sectional study.
Weevaluated 12 euthymic patients with BD-I (in treatment with lithium or valproate or without treatment at least 2 months prior to the study) and 4 participants <scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>psychiatric disorder</dis></scp>.
fMRIwas used to correlate their operative memory processes with the changes seen in the BOLD signal using a paradigm that combines the presentation of blocks and related events.
Results
Control'sbrain activation was greater during response condition compared with bipolar patients.
Whencomparing between patient groups there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05).
_Discussion:_The paradigm we deployed is useful to study activation in brain areas involved in working memory processes.
Theresults with bipolar patients need to be expanded with larger populations to compare other possible <dis>cognitive deficits</dis> and medication specific effects.Abstract
Introduction
Toapprove the prescription of a medication in the United States, the Food and Drug Agency (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) requires at least two Phase III clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medication.
Inthese studies, however, the results can be influenced by the composition of their samples.
Objective
Todescribe issues with the generalizability of results from clinical trials in psychiatry due to the use of highly selected samples.
Methods
Webriefly describe the effects of stringent eligibility criteria on the results of clinical trials.
Wesummarize studies that have examined this issue both in clinical and community samples.
Conclusion
Bothin clinical and community samples, studies have shown that a significant proportion of adults with <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis> are typically excluded by eligibility criteria commonly used in clinical trials.
Thistends to recruit highly selective samples, rather than adults who might be more representative of typical patients.
Clinicaltrials should carefully evaluate the effects of eligibility criteria on the generalizability of their results.
Theuse of stringent exclusionary criteria could limit the representativeness of results.Abstract
Background
Thereare many stereotypes and prejudices about the sexual lives of the elderly.
However,there are no validated and reliable tools for measuring these in the Latin-American context.
Objective
Todetermine the internal consistency, dimensionality, differential item functioning (DIF) by gender and stability of the Attitudes towards Sexuality in the Elderly Questionnaire (ASEQ) in adults over 60 years-old in Cartagena, Colombia.
Method
Avalidation study was designed that included a sample of 130 participants <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp> attending a Life Center.
Theages ranged between 60 and 90 years (mean, 73.7 ± 8.0), and there were 61.5% females.
Internalconsistency was calculated using Cronbach alpha and McDonald omega, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (dimensionality), DIF by gender (item response theory) with Kendall correlation, and stability (reproducibility) with Pearson correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
Results
TheASEQ showed high internal consistency on the first application (α=.83 and ω=.87) and in the second one (α=.85 and ω=.89).
AFEshowed two salient factors (prejudices and limitations) that explained 42.6% of the total variance.
TheIDF presented appropriate coefficients, with the exception of item 14 that showed a high value (τ=.37).
ASEQshowed high stability (r=.82 and ICC=.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.83- 0.92; _P_ <.001).
Conclusions
ASEQis a two-dimensional and reliable scale in older adults attending a Life Center in Cartagena, Colombia.
Newstudies are required to evaluate the performance in a representative sample.Introduction.
Previousstudies suggest that the severity of <dis>alterations in cognitive functions</dis> in people with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder (BP-I) are directly related to the deterioration in overall functioning and life quality. 
<dis>Alteredcognitive function</dis> is associated with a worse prognosis of BP-I, however little is known about the relationship between cognitive functions and the clinical features of BP-I.

Objective.
Toestablish possible associations between cognitive function and the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of patients with BP-I.

Methods.
Cognitivefunction was evaluated by applying a neuropsychological battery to a group of patients with a BP-I diagnosis, who did not have affective episodes for at least 6 months, and who were outpatients treated at the San Juan de Dios Clinic in Manizales. 
Thestatistical analysis involved using clustering methocology in order to divide those patients with the best and worst cognitive function and it was later correlated with the clinical and socio-demographic variables.

Results.
Astatistically significant corrrelation was found between the number of years of education and the age the disorder started with alterations in the level of cognitive function (P=.002 and P=.017 respectively). 
Nosignificant correlations were found with other variables.

Conclusions.
Anearly onset of the pathology and fewer years of education seems to be risk factors associated with poorer cognitive function in patients with BP-I.
Summary
Introduction
Thereare many instruments designed to evaluate motor function in children with <dis>cerebral palsy</dis> (<dis>CP</dis>).
Thepurpose of this study is to provide a Spanish version of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) from its original English version, which is the first step of its cross-cultural adaptation process to the Spanish population.
Materialand methods
TheGMFM is an observational measure designed to evaluate change in gross motor function over time in children with <dis>CP</dis>.
Itis composed of 88 items grouped into five functional dimensions.
Inorder to produce the Spanish version has been used a methodology that involves several steps: translation/back-translation by six bilingual independent translators, committee review and pilot study with three specialists in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.
Results
Fifty-eightitems (66 %) had literal translation, being classified as literal items; 30 items (34 %) suffered syntactic modifications, being classified as similar items.
Afterpre-testing study 3 items were modified because its wording was confusing.
Conclusions
TheSpanish version of the GMFM was obtained, easy to use and well accepted in the daily clinical practice, successfully completed the first step of its crosscultural adaptation process to the Spanish population; we must carry out its validation to complete this pro cess, after checking its clinimetrics characteristics of validity and reliability.Abstract
Objective
Toupdate knowledge about energy cost methods in gait for people with neurological disorders.
Searchstrategy
Wereviewed the following databases: Medline, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Ovid, the Cochrane Library and Sport Discus up to December 2009.
Studyselection
Thosearticles in which energy cost was recorded during gait analysis in people with neurological disorders, especially those related to methodological aspects, were selected.
Atotal of 11 articles were located.
Sixwere related to children with <dis>cerebral palsy</dis>, 1 to traumatic brain injury, 2 to stroke and 2 to spinal cord injury.
Resultsand conclusions
Muchdifference exists in regards to the protocols used to evaluate energy cost of gait in persons with neurological disorders.
Thistype of analysis can be a useful tool to study functional performance in patients with neurological disorders complementary to the biomechanical analysis.Abstract
Objective
Toexamine psychometric performance in a sample of patients with postpolio syndrome (PPS) with subjective cognitive complaints.
Patientsand methods
Thesample consisted of 37 PPS patients (17 men) referred to our outpatient neuropsychological service.
Themean age at the neuropsychological assessment was 55 years (SD: 4.58 years).
Atotal of 59.5% was receiving pharmacological treatment for anxiety-depression.
Theresults obtained by patients in the neuropsychological assessment were compared with normative data to identify the percentage of patients with pathological scores on the tests applied.
Results
Patientswith PPS had pathological scores on all the neuropsychological tests.
Aparticularly significant finding was the percentage of patients with scores indicative of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in tests that assessed cognitive processing speed, verbal learning, phonemic verbal fluency and cognitive flexibility.
Nostatistically significant differences were observed in patients’ performance depending on the presence or absence of anxiety or depression.
Conclusions
Patientswith PPS and subjective cognitive complaints performed less well on neuropsychological assessment than the general population.Abstract
The basal mesolimbic system is among the dopaminergic systems that undergo changes during human evolution and that, under certain conditions, connectivity and abnormal neurotransmission trigger pathological changes during adolescence and adulthood.
Transcranialultrasound in adults is performed through the temporal squama with equipment that has a focal sectorial transducer from 1.8 to 2.8 MHz.
Thekey points of the ultrasound evaluation are mesencephalon, substantia nigra area, raphe, striatum and thalamus, third ventricle, and orbitofrontal sectors.
Despiteits limited anatomical access, it is one of the neuroimaging methods that quantifies the echogenicity (0-3) and the sectional area of the substantia nigra (normal up to 0.2 cm2), which correlates with the worsening of Parkinsonian motor symptoms.
Italso evaluates and measures the raphe (normal 1 mm) which correlates with humour or apathy.
Thicknesschanges of the mesencephalic tegmentum (interpeduncular angle, smaller or greater than 60°), thalamus and striatum increased echogenicity, and the third ventricle dilation (greater than 5 mm), are other possible findings.
Theseare used to corroborate the diagnosis, classification, treatment and monitoring of different pathologies, like Parkinson's disease, supranuclear progressive palsy, dystonias, cortico-basal degeneration, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and <dis>autism</dis>.Current studies based on specific naming subcategories are scarce and specially if they are combined with cortical electrical stimulation mapping (CES). 
Mostresearchers use generic categories of objects that have not shown to be useful for epileptic patients. 
Thepresent study explores the ability to retrieve words with the aim of naming entities through CES during surgery of a patient with left temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) prior to anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). 
Duringthe CES we observed alterations in the naming of faces, living things (LTh) and parts of the body, with conservation of non-living things (NLTh). 
CESallowed the identification and prediction of regions at risk of being resected. 
Thisresult shows that the naming deficits are selective and can be used as indicators and predictors of <dis>post-operative cognitive dysfunction</dis> in TLE since the regions involved in this function are associated with the pole and inferior and medial temporal gyrus.
Abstract
Mooren's ulcer is a painful peripheral corneal ulcer, still unknown cause that can cause <dis>vision loss</dis> if not properly treated; severe pain is common in patients with Mooren ulcer and is associated with red eye, inflammation, photophobia and tearing.
Thetreatment used range from steroidal and non- steroidal anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic drugs (topical and systemic) and surgical treatments such as superficial keratectomy and penetrating keratoplasty, the selection of the same is individual for each patient according to their presentation and evolution, there is none selected as the most effective in this disease.
Acase of Mooren's ulcer is presented, its clinical form type 2, biomicroscopy corneal images are exposed.Introduction.

Bothlesions were delimited with laser observing a spontaneous resolution of the detachment <scp><neg>without</neg> presenting <dis>visual impairment</dis> during the follow-up</scp>.
Discussion
Althoughintraocular botulinum toxin does not generate retinal toxicity, inadvertent intraocular injection should be closely monitored to avoid complications secondary to perforation.Abstract
Introduction
Givencurrent interest in the field of ageing, the objective of this study was to determine the factors related to quality of life that underlie healthy ageing.
Twoareas were analyzed: firstly, the influence of specific quality- of-life variables on the scores of the Mini Examen Cognoscitivo (MEC), on the classification of subjects as healthy or with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>), and on the results of specific memory tests and, secondly, the predictive character of these variables in these tests.
Materialsand methods
Weperformed an inferential study in an incidental sample composed of 140 elderly persons whose memory, praxis, language, and executive function were evaluated using a battery of neuropsychological tests.
Datarelated to lifestyle and clinical history were collected at an interview.
Results
Usinga series of univariate analyses, we observed that alcohol consumption and a history of cerebrovascular accident affected the results of the MEC and of some of the memory tests, as well as the classification of a subject as healthy versus impaired.
Abackward regression analysis confirmed the predictive value of these variables in the MEC scores and in some of the memory tests.
Conclusions
Somevariables related to quality of life and lifestyle affect the results of certain cognitive tests.
Giventhe current interest this area arouses, future studies that make quality-of-life variables more operative and include factors such as physical exercise are required.Aims
_a)_ to describe postural control disorders in elderly patients with recurrent falls; _b)_ to analyze the influence of <dis>sensory deficits</dis> on centre of gravity control mechanisms; and _c)_ to assess the functional consequences of balance disorders and falls in this group of patients.
Materialand methods
patientsaged more than 65 years old referred to a falls unit with two or more falls in the previous 6 months were included in this study.
Theprotocol included posturographic studies with a Neurocom Balance Master.
Toevaluate motor control, Rhythmic Weight Shift (RWS test) was performed.
Toassess sensorial control, Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (MCT test) was used.
Othertests performed were the Sit to Stand (SS test), Walk across (WA test) and Step up over (SO test).
Results
atotal of 109 patients (85.3% women) were studied.
Meanage was 78.01 years (SD: 5.38).
Disordersin one or more afferent sensorial systems were found in 51.7% of the patients (27.5% <dis>visual deficiencies</dis>, 17.6% vestibular alterations, and 6.6% <dis>somatosensorial deficits</dis>).
Twoafferent systems were compromised in 25.3%, and all three were compromised in 11.1% of the patients.
Nosignificant differences were found in directional control (RWS) when compared with the number of altered systems.
Conclusions
posturographicstudies provide sensitive information on static and dynamic centre of gravity control systems, eventual sensory deficits, and patients’ ability to carry out basic activities of daily living.
Inour sample, the most frequent deficit was <dis>visual impairment</dis>.
Thisinformation is essential to establish a correct management programme.Objective
todetermine the prevalence of the use of physical restraints in public nursing homes through the Residents’ Functional Classification Information System in order to assess the introduction of a protocol designed to reduce and rationalize the use of these devices.
Materialand methods
twenty-fivepublic nursing homes in the autonomous region of Madrid were included in this study.
Thefollowing data on the use of physical restraints were analysed: frequency of use (daily or less than daily), type of device, level of <dis>functional dependence for activities of daily living</dis>, and severity of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Results
atotal of 5346 residents were included.
Theprevalence of the use of restraints was 8.4%.
Whenthe use of bedrails was added, this percentage rose to 20.8%.
Bedrailsaccounted for 63.4% of all restraints used, trunk restraints for 17.7%, limb restraints for 3%, and chairs preventing voluntary rising for 15.9%.
Asingle device was used in 62.6%.
Ofthe restraints, 71.4% were used daily and 28.6% were used temporarily.
Conclusions
theresults of this study represent an approxima-tion to the current use of physical restraints in nursing homes.
Theprevalence found was similar to, or less than, that observed in previous studies.
Themost commonly used form of restraint was bedrails.
Theuse of these devices is probably excessive, affecting even residents <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> or <dis>physical dependence</dis></scp>.
Toreduce the use of restraints and guarantee optimal care when their application is indicated, the Regional Social Welfare Service systematically applies a protocol for the prevention and use of physical restraints.Abstract
Introduction
Pressureulcer (PU) infection is a significant clinical problem in many elderly patients.
Materialand methods
Todetermine the microbiology of PU and vascular ulcer (VU) infections by conducting a cross-sectional study of outpatients treated in a chronic wounds unit over an 18 month period.
Results
Sixtysix patients with PU infection and 159 patients with an infected VU were identified.
ThePUs were located below the knee in 36 patients (52%).
Patientswith pressure ulcers had a higher proportion of institutionalization, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, <dis>inability to walk</dis>, and sphincter incontinence.
Therewas a greater number of infections caused by _Enterobacteriaceae_ (52%, _P_ =.002) and fewer _S. aureus_ infections (24%, _P_ <.001) in patients with a PU compared to those with those with a VU.
Forty-onepercent of _S. aureus_ strains isolated in all the patients were resistant to methicillin (MRSA).
Theproportion of _Enterobacteriaceae_ infections was similar in patients with infection of pelvic girdle PU and in those located below the knee.
Conclusions
PUpatients suffer a higher rate of infection by enterobacteria.
Themost common pathogen in UV infections is _S. aureus_.
Theproportion of MRSA infection in patients with chronic wounds is high.
Themicrobiology of the infection in the pelvic girdle PU is similar to those located below the knee.
Introduction
Theprevention and management of <dis>neurocognitive disorders</dis> (<dis>NCD</dis>) among older adults can be improved by early identification of risk factors such as walking speed. 
Theobjective of the study is to assess the association between gait speed and <dis>NCD</dis> onset in a population of Peruvian older adults.
Materialand methods
Cohortconducted in older adults who attended the geriatrics service of Naval Medical Center (Callao, Peru). 
Duringthe baseline assessment, participants’ gait speed was recorded. 
Subsequently,participants were followed-up annually for 5 years, with a mean of 21 months. 
<dis>NCD</dis>onset was defined as the occurrence of a score ≤24 points on the Mini Mental State Examination (screening test) during follow-up. 
Thehazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using Cox regression.
Results
Thestudy included 657 participants, with a mean age of 73.4±9.2 (SD) years, of whom 47.0% were male, 47.8% had a gait speed <0.8 m/s, and 20.1% developed <dis>NCD</dis> during the follow up. 
Itwas found that older adults who had gait speed <0.8 m/s at baseline were more likely to develop <dis>NCD</dis> than those who had a gait speed ≥0.8 m/s (adjusted HR=1.41, 95% CI=1.34-1.47).
Conclusion
Alongitudinal association was found between decreased gait speed and <dis>NCD</dis> onset, suggesting that gait speed could be useful to identify patients at risk of <dis>NCD</dis> onset.Abstract
Introduction
Inour environment, <dis>cerebral palsy</dis> (<dis>CP</dis>) is the most common cause of <dis>physical disability</dis> in children.
Thepeople with <dis>CP</dis> have problems with muscle tone and that cause musculoskeletal deformities and postural and balance disorders.
Physiotherapyis required from birth.
Themain objective of this study is to improve psychomotor development of children with <dis>CP</dis> using video games in physical therapy treatment.
Patientsand methods
Alongitudinal, prospective experimental pretest posttest design type with one group.
Participantswere 8 patients with <dis>CP</dis> aged between 6 and 12, I-II level in GMFCS and score between 75%-100% in GMFM-88.
Physiotherapyintervention uses the Nintendo Wii console and the Wii-fit balance board game for 15 sessions.
Balance(Berg scale), location load-distribution center of gravity (with the software of the balance board), and motivation in physical therapy sessions (measured by an ad-hoc scale) were studied.
Thestudy was conducted during the 2013-2014 school year in the physiotherapy room of a school.
Results
Thisstudy shows statistically significant evidence supporting the improvement in balance, in patient satisfaction and more adequate distribution in the load of the lower limbs.
Discussionand conclusions
Virtualreality helps in achieving different objectives of physiotherapy, with interesting use to improve balance and postural control.
Theresults support the use of the Wii console as a complement, never a substitute, the child with PCI physiotherapist treatment.Objective
Todescribe the initial treatment of patients >60 years who had subjective memory complaints and/or <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> for at least 6 months.
Design
Observational,longitudinal, multicentre, and naturalistic study, with a follow-up period of 12 months.
Setting
Atotal of 105 primary care centres.
Participants
Thestudy included 921 patients who attended a clinic.
Mainmeasurements
Inthe baseline visit, the social demographic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and the health care referrals were recorded, and in the next 2 (6 and 12 months) the diagnostic change, treatment, and referrals.
Results
Themajority of subjects were female (66.9%) and the mean age was 74.3 ± 6.8 years.
Inthe initial visit, 50.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.3-53.7) of the diagnoses were classed as syndromic and 33.3% (95% CI, 30.3-36.3), aetiological.
Theprimary care doctor modified an unconfirmed initial diagnosis in 22% (95% CI, 19.3-24.7) of the patients during the 12 months follow-up study.
Adiagnosis was made in 63.8% (95% CI, 60.7-66.9) of patients by anamnesis, physical examination, the screening test, and laboratory data.
Inthe initial visit, el 52.6% (95% CI, 49.4-55.8) received treatment of mainly nootropics and neuroprotectors, and later, the percentage of patients on cholinesterase inhibitors increased.
Theprimary care doctor referred 54.9% (95% CI, 51.7-58.1) of the patients during the 12 months of the study.
Conclusions
Theprimary care doctor diagnoses the majority of patients with the means available, mainly based on anamnesis, examination, the screening test, and laboratory data.
Theyprescribe drugs that lack efficacy for this disease and few of those that have been shown to be effective.Objective

Conclusion
TheLSPQ questionnaire in Spanish (LSPQ-e) is a reliable tool, designed to help patients to clarify their care and treatment preferences at the end of their lives.Abstract
Objective
Toevaluate the diagnostic accuracy (DA) of the Mini-Mental State (MMS) for the detection of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>CI</dis>) in Primary Care (PC) and to determine the best conditions of use for that purpose.
Design
Pooledanalysis of two prospective, double blind, studies on the evaluation of diagnostic tools with complete verification that were conducted in Madrid and Granada (Spain).
Setting
TheMMS was administered in PC and the final cognitive diagnosis (gold standard) was made in Specialized Care.
Participants
Subjectswith cognitive complaints or suspected of having <dis>CI</dis> were consecutively recruited in the PC clinic.
Principalmeasures
TheDA of the MMS was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).
Thebest cut-off point was selected according to the ratio of cases correctly classified (RCC) and to the _kappa_ index.
Direct(MMSd) and age- and education-adjusted (MMSa) total scores were analyzed separately.
Results
Inthe total sample of 360 subjects (214 <dis>CI</dis>), the DA of the MMSd was significantly superior to that of the MMSa (0.84 ± 0.02 vs 0.82 ± 0.02, p ≤ .001).
Theyield obtained by the best cut-off point of the MMSd (22/23) was modest (RCC 0.77, _kappa_ 0.52 ± 0.05) and was not improved by any MMSa cut- off point.
Conclusion
TheDA of the MMS for detection of <dis>CI</dis> in PC was modest and did not improve with adjustment of the score by age and education.
Thebest cut-off point was 22/23, inferior to the usually recommended cut-off.Abstract
Objective
Toassess the influence of an educational intervention in reducing «fear- avoidance» (FA) and «pain catastrophising» (CAT) in a population with unspecific chronic low back pain (UCLBP), attending physiotherapy in Primary Health Care.
Apragmatic quasi-experimental study was conducted in Health Centres of a Costa del Sol Health District.
Design
Quasi-experimentalstudy.
Setting
PrimaryHealth Care physiotherapy Back Schools in Health Centres of a Costa del Sol Health District.
Participants
Theselection criteria were: UCLBP; 18-65 years; understanding of the Spanish language; absence of parallel educational interventions; absence of red flags; <scp><neg>not</neg> showing <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> or fibromyalgia</scp>; absence of thoracic-lumbar surgery, and exercise tolerance.
Interventions
Thecontrol group received the usual Back Schools program.
Theexperimental group also received a written document for home reading, plus the subsequent sharing, clarifying doubts, and beliefs and goals restructuring during the development of the sessions.
Bothinterventions lasted about 280 minutes (7 sessions × 40 min).
Results
Themain variables included FA and CAT.
Painand disability were also assessed.
Some«demographic» and «related disorder» variables were considered in the analysis.
Statisticallysignificant differences were observed in the experimental group versus control, in the variation of FA −14 (−25.5; 0) vs −4 (−13; 0) ( _P_ = .009), and CAT −9 (−18; −4) vs −4,5 (−8.25; 0) ( _P_ = .000), were observed.
Alsodifferences in disability ( _P_ = .046), but not in pain ( _P_ = .280).
Conclusions
Theseresults should be considered in light of possible limits imposed by the study.
Itspragmatic nature would allow a potential transfer to usual care.Abstract
Introduction and objectives
Thepurpose of the episodic memory test and the caregiver's episodic memory test is to evaluate episodic memory according to its definition in a way that is feasible for families and achieves high degrees of sensitivity and specificity.
Methodsand results
Weadministered a test consisting of 10 questions about episodic events to 332 subjects, of whom 65 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), 115 had <dis>amnestic MCI</dis> (<dis>aMCI</dis>) and 152 showed <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> according to Reisberg's global deterioration scale</scp> (GDS).
Wecalculated the test's sensitivity and specificity to distinguish AD from <dis>episodic aMCI</dis> and from normal ageing.
Thearea under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of <dis>aMCI</dis> was 0.94 and the best cut- off value was 20; for that value, sensitivity was 89% and specificity was 82%.
Fora diagnosis of AD, the area under the ROC curve was 0.99 and the best cut- off point was 17, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 91%.
Asubsequent study using similar methodology yielded similar results when the test was administered directly by the caregiver.
Conclusions
Theepisodic memory test and the caregiver's episodic memory test are useful as brief screening tools for identifying patients with early-stage AD.
Itis suitable for use by primary care medical staff and in the home, since it can be administered by a caregiver.
Thetest's limitations are that it must be administered by a reliable caregiver and the fact that it measures episodic memory only.Abstract
Introduction
Differentanimal models for Alzheimer disease (AD) have been designed to support the hypothesis that the neurodegeneration (loss of neurons and synapses with reactive gliosis) associated with Aβ and tau deposition in these models is similar to that in the human brain.
Thesealterations produce functional changes beginning with <dis>decreased ability to carry out daily and social life activities</dis>, <dis>memory loss</dis>, and <dis>neuropsychiatric disorders</dis> in general.
Neuronalalteration plays an important role in early stages of the disease, especially in the CA1 area of hippocampus in both human and animal models.
Methods
Twogroups ( _WT_ and 3xTg-AD) of 11-month-old female mice were used in a behavioural analysis (nest building) and a morphometric analysis of the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus.
Results
The3xTg-AD mice showed a 50% reduction in nest quality associated with a significant increase in damaged neurons in the CA1 hippocampal area (26% ± 6%, _P_ < .05) compared to the _WT_ group.
Conclusions
The<dis>decreased ability to carry out activities of daily living</dis> (humans) or nest building (3xTg-AD mice) is related to the neuronal alterations observed in AD.
Thesealterations are controlled by the hippocampus.
_Post-mortem_analyses of the human hippocampus, and the CA1 region in 3xTg-AD mice, show that these areas are associated with alterations in the deposition of Aβ and tau proteins, which start accumulating in the early stages of AD.Abstract
Introduction
Thegoals of this study were to compare the early diagnostic utility of Alzheimer disease biomarkers in the CSF with those in brain MRI in conditions found in our clinical practice, and to ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of both techniques used together.
Methods
Between2008 and 2009, we included 30 patients with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>) who were examined using 1.5 Tesla brain MRI and AD biomarker analysis in CSF.
MRIstudies were evaluated by 2 radiologists according to the Korf́s visual scale.
CSFbiomarkers were analysed using INNOTEST reagents for Aβ1-42, total-tau and phospho-tau181p.
Weevaluated clinical changes 2 years after inclusion.
Results
By2 years after inclusion, 15 of the original 30 patients (50%) had developed AD (NINCDS-ADRA criteria).
Thepredictive utility of AD biomarkers in CSF (RR 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.7; _P_ <.01) was greater than that of MRI (RR 1.5; 95% CI 95%, 0.7-3.4; _P_ <.2); using both techniques together yielded a sensitivity and a negative predictive value of 100%.
Normalresults on both complementary tests ruled out progression to AD (100%) within 2 years of inclusion.
Conclusions
Ourresults show that the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers in CSF is higher than that of biomarkers in MRI.
Combineduse of both techniques is highly accurate for either early diagnosis or exclusion of AD in patients with <dis>MCI</dis>.Abstract
Introduction
<dis>Globaldevelopmental delay</dis> (<dis>GDD</dis>) and <dis>intellectual disability</dis> (<dis>ID</dis>) are common reasons for consultation in paediatric neurology.
Resultsfrom aetiological evaluations of children with <dis>GDD</dis>/<dis>ID</dis> vary greatly, and consequently, there is no universal consensus regarding which studies should be performed.
Materialand method
Wereview our experience with determining aetiological diagnoses for children with <dis>GDD</dis>/<dis>ID</dis> who were monitored by the paediatric neurology unit over the 5-year period between 2006 and 2010.
Results
Duringthe study period, 995 children with <dis>GDD</dis>/<dis>ID</dis> were monitored.
Anaetiological diagnosis was established for 309 patients (31%), but not in 686 (69%), despite completing numerous tests.
Agenetic cause was identified in 142 cases (46% of the total aetiologies established), broken down as 118 cases of genetic encephalopathy and 24 of metabolic hereditary diseases.
Ourdata seem to indicate that diagnosis is easier when <dis>GDD</dis>/<dis>ID</dis> is associated with <dis>cerebral palsy</dis>, epilepsy, infantile spasms/West syndrome, or <dis>visual deficit</dis>, but more difficult in cases of <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis>.
Geneticstudies provide an increasing number of aetiological diagnoses, and they are also becoming the first step in diagnostic studies.
ArrayCGH (microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation) is the genetic test with the highest diagnostic yield in children with unexplained <dis>GDD</dis>/<dis>ID</dis>.
Discussion
Thecost-effectiveness of complementary studies seems to be low if there are no clinically suspected entities.
However,even in the absence of treatment, aetiological diagnosis is always important in order to provide genetic counselling and possible prenatal diagnosis, resolve family (and doctors’) queries, and halt further diagnostic studies.Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), which presents in patients younger than 65 years, has frequently been described as having different features from those of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). 
Thisreview analyses the most recent studies comparing the clinical presentation and neuropsychological, neuropathological, genetic, and neuroimaging findings of both types in order to determine whether EOAD and LOAD are different entities or distinct forms of the same entity. 
Weobserved consistent differences between clinical findings in EOAD and in LOAD.
Fundamentally,the onset of EOAD is more likely to be marked by atypical symptoms, and cognitive assessments point to <dis>poorer executive and visuospatial functioning and praxis</dis> with less marked <dis>memory impairment</dis>. 
Alzheimer-typefeatures will be more dense and widespread in neuropathology studies, with structural and functional neuroimaging showing greater and more diffuse atrophy extending to neocortical areas (especially the precuneus). 
Inconclusion, available evidence suggests that EOAD and LOAD are 2 different forms of a single entity. 
LOADis likely to be influenced by ageing-related processes.Introduction.
Althoughantidepressants are widely used in Parkinson's disease (PD), few well-designed studies to support their efficacy have been conducted.

Development.
Theseclinical guidelines are based on a review of the literature and the results of an AMN <dis>movement disorder</dis> study group survey.

Conclusions.
Evidencesuggests that nortriptyline, venlafaxine, paroxetine, and citalopram may be useful in treating depression in PD, although studies on paroxetine and citalopram yield conflicting results. 
Inclinical practice, however, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are usually considered the treatment of choice. 
Duloxetinemay be an alternative to venlafaxine, although the evidence for this is less, and venlafaxine plus mirtazapine may be useful in drug-resistant cases. 
Furthermore,citalopram may be indicated for the treatment of anxiety, atomoxetine for hypersomnia, trazodone and mirtazapine for insomnia and psychosis, and bupropion for apathy. 
Ingeneral, antidepressants are well tolerated in PD. 
However,clinicians should consider the anticholinergic effect of tricyclic antidepressants, the impact of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors on blood pressure, the extrapyramidal effects of antidepressants, and any potential interactions between monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and other antidepressants.
Introduction
Theclinical problems of patients with <dis>movement disorders</dis> (<dis>MD</dis>) are complex, and the duration and frequency of face-to-face consultations may be insufficient to meet their needs. 
Weanalysed the implementation of an e-mail-based query service for our MD unit's patients and their primary care physicians (PCPs).
Methods
Weretrospectively reviewed all consecutive emails sent and received over a period of 4 months, one year after implementation of the e-mail inquiry system. 
Allpatients received the during consultations, and PCPs, during scheduled informative meetings. 
Werecorded and later analysed the profile of the questioner, patients’ demographic and clinical data, number of queries, reason for consultation, and actions taken.
Results
From1 January 2015 to 30 April 2015, the service received 137 emails from 63 patients (43% male, mean age 71±10.5) diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (76%), atypical parkinsonism (10%), and others (14%); 116 responses were sent. 
Twenty(32%) emails were written by patients, 38 (60%) by their caregivers, and 5 (8%) by their PCPs. 
Thereasons for consultation were clinical in 50 cases (80%): 16 (32%) described clinical deterioration, 14 (28%) onset of new symptoms, and 20 (40%) side effects or concerns about medications. 
In13 cases (20%), the query was bureaucratic: 11 were related to appointments (85%) and 2 were requests for clinical reports (15%). 
Inresponse, new appointments were scheduled in 9 cases (14%), while the rest of the questions were answered by email. 
Patientswere satisfied overall and the additional care burden on specialists was not excessive.
Conclusions
Implementingan e-mail-based consultation system is feasible in MD units. 
Itfacilitates both communication between neurologists and patients and continued care in the primary care setting.Introduction
<dis>Cognitiveimpairment</dis>, a clinical entity causing <dis>complete or partial intellectual dysfunction</dis>, is a major public health concern that poses a challenge for health and social services. 
Thepurpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of this disorder in people aged 65 and older visiting the primary care physician in 5 health sentinel networks.
Method
Asample of patients visiting their primary care doctor on 4 randomly selected days completed the Mini-Cog screening test. 
Diagnosisof <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was confirmed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Questionnaire. 
Weestimated raw and adjusted rates using demographic and social variables.
Results
Weincluded 4,624 patients from 5 autonomous communities and representing a population of 1,723,216 inhabitants. 
Theadjusted prevalence rate was 18.5% (95% CI 17.3-19.7], with differences between sentinel networks.
Womenshowed higher adjusted rates than men: 18.5 vs. 14.3%.
Thehighest prevalence rate was observed in people aged 85 and older (45.3%); prevalence rates vary depending on education level and marital status.
Conclusions
<dis>Cognitiveimpairment</dis> is a frequent reason for consultations in primary care. 
Itsprevalence is higher in women and increases exponentially with age. 
Anumber of sensitive, validated tools have been proven useful in screening for and confirming <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>. 
Usingthese tools in primary care settings enables early treatment of these patients.
Introduction
Thedefinition, associated aetiologies, diagnosis, and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or pseudotumour cerebri (PTC), are constantly being revised in the paediatric population.
Objectivesand methods
Ourstudy included children younger than 15 years old with PTC and attended at a reference hospital in the past 12 years. 
Weanalysed the clinical and epidemiological features of our sample and the diagnostic and treatment approaches. 
PTCwas defined as presence of intracranial hypertension (CSF opening pressure>25cmH2O) and absence of space-occupying lesions in brain MR images.
Results
Atotal of 12 children with PTC were included; mean age was 10 years and 90% were girls. 
Weightwas normal in all patients. 
Eighty-twopercent of the patients had symptoms: headache (66%), diplopia (8%), and <dis>visual loss</dis> (8%). 
Allof them displayed papilloedema (17% unilaterally). 
Lumbarpuncture (LP) provided the diagnosis in all cases and 91% showed no relevant MRI findings. 
Apotential cause of PTC was identified in 5 cases: pharmacological treatment in 2 and infection (Mycoplasma pneumoniae [M. pneumoniae]) in 3. 
Ninety-oneper cent of the patients received treatment: 75% underwent several LPs and 42% received acetazolamide and/or prednisone. 
Outcomeswere favourable in all cases.
Conclusions
Theincidence of PTC was estimated at approximately 1 case per 100 000 children/years, in line with data reported by previous studies. 
Overweightwas not found to be a risk factor for PTC in this population. 
M.pneumoniae infection may trigger PTC and cause recurrences at later stages. 
Theabsence of symptoms seems to be independent from the degree of intracranial hypertension. 
Acetazolamidetreatment is effective in most cases, and it represents a viable alternative to repeated LP.Introduction.
Giventhat surgical treatment of refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy may cause <dis>memory impairment</dis>, determining which patients are eligible for surgery is essential. 
However,there is little agreement on which presurgical memory assessment methods are best able to predict memory outcome after surgery and identify those patients with a greater risk of surgery-induced memory decline.

Objective.
Weconducted a systematic literature review to determine which presurgical memory assessment methods best predict memory outcome.

Materialand methods.
Theliterature search of PubMed gathered articles published between January 2005 and December 2015 addressing pre- and postsurgical memory assessment in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients by means of neuropsychological testing, functional MRI, and other neuroimaging techniques. 
Weobtained 178 articles, 31 of which were included in our review.

Results.
Mostof the studies used neuropsychological tests and fMRI; these methods are considered to have the greatest predictive ability for <dis>memory impairment</dis>. 
Otherless frequently used techniques included the Wada test and FDG-PET.

Conclusions.
Currentevidence supports performing a presurgical assessment of memory function using both neuropsychological tests and functional MRI to predict memory outcome after surgery.
Introduction
Chronickidney disease (CKD) can cause anaemia and neurological disorders. 
Recombinanthuman erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is used to manage anaemia in CKD. 
However,there is little evidence on the effects of rHuEPO on behaviour and cognitive function in CKD. 
Thisstudy aimed to evaluate the impact of rHuEPO in sensorimotor and cognitive functions in a CKD model.
Methods
MaleWistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control and CKD, with and without rHuEPO treatment (1050 IU per kg body weight, once weekly for 4 weeks). 
TheMorris water maze, open field, and adhesive removal tests were performed simultaneously to kidney damage induction and treatment. 
Markersof anaemia and renal function were measured at the end of the study.
Results
Treatmentwith rHuEPO reduced kidney damage and corrected anaemia in rats with CKD. 
Weobserved reduced <dis>sensorimotor dysfunction</dis> in animals with CKD and treated with rHuEPO. 
Theserats also completed the water maze test in a shorter time than the control groups.
Conclusions
rHuEPOreduces kidney damage, corrects anemia, and reduces <dis>sensorimotor and cognitive dysfunction</dis> in animals with CKD.Introduction
AlthoughGuillain-Barré syndrome is rare, a marked increase in incidence was observed during the 2016 Zika outbreak in the Americas, with no direct causal relationship being apparent in all cases.
Methods
Casesof febrile exanthematous disease and acute flaccid paralysis were reviewed during the period from 1 August to 15 December, 2016; clinical and biochemical assessment was performed for each case to identify Zika-related Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Results
Duringthe study period, we identified 8 patients (6 men and 2 women) with Zika-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, with the most affected age group being 50-59 years. 
Thehighest incidence was in the month of September, with 7 cases. 
Themost frequent symptoms were rash and conjunctivitis, followed by fever. 
Themost common presentation was <dis>symmetrical ascending paralysis</dis>, present in 7 cases. 
Cranialnerve VII was the most frequently involved nerve. 
Only2 patients presented albuminocytologic dissociation. 
RT-PCRreturned negative results for Zika virus in all patients. 
Allpatients received intravenous immunoglobulin and all had a good prognosis. 
Nonewarranted mechanical ventilation. 
Nodeaths were recorded. 
Thecumulative incidence rate was 3.9%, monthly incidence was between 0.04 and 2 cases/month.
Conclusions
Casesof Guillain-Barré syndrome increased during the Zika outbreak, with an increase in incidence and number of cases per month; however, a direct causal relationship between the 2 conditions could not be demonstrated.   Summary
Objectives
Westudied the factors that can increase the risk of accidents among elderly persons who had <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive deterioration</dis></scp> in the province of Guadalajara, Spain.
Methods
Across-sectional, observational study was made in a primary care setting in which urban and rural areas were differentiated.
Aquestionnaire (confirmed by a pilot study and analysis of the stability of responses using the kappa coefficient) was administered to a randomized, stratified sample in different stages.
Thesample was proportional in age, sex, and population centers.
Thevariables studied were the cohabitants of the home, type of home, architectural barriers in the home, heating systems, periodic eye and ear checkups, use of corrective lenses and hearing aids, traffic safety, and sociodemographic variables.
Datawere analyzed using descriptive, analytical, and multivariant statistical procedures and logistical regression.
Thesample included 473 persons from rural areas and 477 persons from an urban area.
Thefinal study sample included 388 persons from rural areas and 392 persons from an urban area.
Thepercentage of losses ranged from 16% (males from a rural area) to 26% (females from a rural area).
Results
Thetype of home differed depending on the area.
One-storyhomes predominated in rural areas.
Inevery case, over 80% of the homes had 1 to 4 architectural barriers, particularly the absence of handbars in bathrooms, presence of rugs and carpets, changes in floor level, and stairs.
Thepercentage of elderly persons who underwent eye or hearing checkups less than once a year was over 75% for eye checkups and over 90% for hearing checkups, regardless of the area.
Althoughthe use of seatbelts is obligatory, 3% to 7% of the elderly do not use them.
Conclusions
Theprevalence of conditions that increase the risk of accidents for persons over 65 was high in our province.
Thisstudy highlights the need for corrective measures.Abstract
Objective
Toevaluate the association between life satisfaction and socioeconomic status and self-reported health in a cohort of older people in Santiago, Chile, in 2005 and 2006.
Methods
Weinterviewed 2002 individuals aged 65 to 67.9 years registered in 20 primary care centers in the city of Santiago.
Participantswere living independently <scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>, suspected cancer or terminal diseases.
Weassessed life satisfaction using an abbreviated adaptation of a life satisfaction scale (scored from 0 to 11), and collected self-reported information on income, education, social support, and self-reported health and memory.
Weused a log-binomial model to analyze the association between life satisfaction scores (fourth quartile compared with the first) and socioeconomic and health variables.
Results
Therewas a significant association (bivariate and multivariate analyses) between life satisfaction and income in men and with social support, self- reported health, memory, and diagnosis of joint problems, diabetes and hypertension in both sexes.
Conclusion
Socialsupport, income and health status were independently associated with life satisfaction in older people aged 65-67.9 years in Santiago.
Furtherstudies are required to assess the temporal direction of the effect and the implications of these findings for public health policies in this population.Abstract
NEUROBEL (Neuropsychological assessment of language in adults) is a brief battery that allows a screening of the basic processes of language comprehension and production.
Itconsists of 8 tasks, assessing oral-language processing from the theoretical model of cognitive neuropsychology.
Theaim has been to carry out a pilot study of initial normative data for NEUROBEL battery in older-adults.
Thisin mind, we studied a sample of 30 male and female healthy participants aged over 50 <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp> (MMSE ≥ 25).
TheNEUROBEL battery was administered to all the participants, which were split into 2 groups: “adults” (50-64) and “older-adults” (> 65).
Thelatter group was also analyzed according to their usual residence (private home or nursing home).
Inthe Results section, it is shown the scores and time performances of the participants in the battery, as well as main percentiles.
NEUROBELis shown as a valid and reliable battery, including high Pearson's correlations among the tasks.
UnivariateANOVAs show group and schooling effects in the scores of the battery for younger and more schooled participants.
Conversely,sex factor does not influence the results achieved, although it is shown as significant variable in favor of the women for time execution of the tasks.
Somedifferences among participants over 65 years old, depending on their usual place of residence and sex are debated in the Discussion.Abstract
Case Report
Wereview a patient with ocular manifestations of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
Itwas a cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) in a woman with <dis>visual loss</dis>, and attenuated and sheathed retinal arterioles.
Theelectroretinography (ERG) showed severe abnormalities of the a and b-waves.
Thetumour process was not discovered until 6 months later, when a squamous neoplasia that invaded the uterus and vagina was observed.
Discussion
Paraneoplasticsyndromes are a group of manifestations produced as a remote effect of cancer cells.
CARsyndrome is caused by autoimmune reactions to retinal antigens induced by aberrant expression of recoverin in cancer tissues.
Ophthalmologistsmust be aware of ocular paraneoplastic signs as they can be the first manifestations of a malignant tumour.Abstract
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause of retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy.
Despitethe existence of several possible treatment options, none was entirely satisfactory and many patients suffered <dis>irreversible visual loss</dis>.
Asa result of the BRAVO, CRUISE and GENEVA trials, ranibizumab and the intravitreal biodegradable implants of dexamethasone has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of RVO secondary edema.
Inthis paper we begin by describing the current treatment options for RVO associated macular edema and continue with the description of the treatment regimen with ranibizumab.Abstract
Clinical case
Apatient with acute amaurosis due central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), who had mitral regurgitation and _Streptococcus viridans_ positive blood cultures.
Usingtransesophageal ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis without fever, and with <dis>loss of vision</dis> as the only symptom.
Discussion
CRAOdue to infective endocarditis is rare and there are few cases reported in the literature.
Semiologyand a systematic and comprehensive study of patients with this ophthalmological pathology helps uncover serious underlying medical conditions.
Infectiveendocarditis has many different forms of presentation and a high clinical suspicion is often required to reach a diagnosis.Abstract
Objective
Theaim of this study was to assess the safety and surgical results of combined pars plana vitrectomy and femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (femtophacovitrectomy).
Materialand methods
Aprospective, non-comparative case series was conducted by selecting patients with cataract and vitreoretinal pathology who underwent femtophacovitrectomy by a single surgeon at the _Hospital Central Militar_ between June 2013 and February 2014.
Anevaluation was made of the preoperative characteristics, surgical indications, results, and postoperative complications, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months.
Results
Thestudy included 35 eyes of 35 patients, of whom 20 (57.1%) were male.
Themean age was 60.76 ± 4.2 years.
Diagnosesincluded vitreous haemorrhage (19 cases), macular hole (6 cases), epiretinal membrane (7), and tractional detachment (5 cases).
Themean best corrected visual acuity was 1.3 LogMAR before surgery, and 0.5 LogMAR at 3-months follow-up ( _P_ <.05).
<scp><neg>No</neg>patient had <dis>visual loss</dis></scp>.
Theintra-operative complication was miosis in 14.28%.
Inthe early postoperative period (<1 month), all had subconjunctival haemorrhage, with moderate corneal oedema in 20% of cases, and only 2.85% (one case) ocular hypertension associated with use of intraocular gas.
Therewere no cases of endophthalmitis.
Themean follow-up was 13.3 months (10-16 months).
Conclusions
Theuse of femtosecond laser in phacovitrectomy is a safe and effective alternative, with similar risk of complications in cases of macular pathology, tractional retinal detachment, and/or vitreous haemorrhage.Case report
Thecase is presented of a 32 year-old male with no medical history of interest who suffered a traffic accident with mild traumatic brain injury. 
Hehad a left supraciliary incised and contused wound that extended to the left upper eyelid, <scp><neg>with no</neg> <dis>loss of vision</dis></scp>.
Afterpalpebral anaesthetic injection, there was a sudden visual acuity decrease in the left eye and hyposphagma located between I-III at 4mm from the limbus, with increased intraocular pressure. 
Awhitish lesion with a central haemorrhagic focus was observed in the ocular fundus, corresponding to the area where the hyposphagma was located.
Discussion
Anaestheticinjection during palpebral repair may be complicated by inadvertent penetration of the eyeball. 
Intravitrealmepivacaine and adrenaline could cause macular and retinal lesions.Introduction.
Glaucomais a chronic asymptomatic disease, progressing to <dis>loss of vision</dis>. 
Elevatedintraocular pressure is the only modifiable factor. 
Adherenceto glaucoma treatment varies from 2-80%.

Objective.
Toevaluate factors associated with adherence to topical glaucoma treatment reported in the literature, and to identify protective factors and risk factors, as well as modifiable and non-modifiable factors, in order to take them into account to perform interventions in adherence.

Materialsand methods.
Abibliographic search of articles published in the last 8 years in databases such as Clinical Key, Cochrane (OVID), EBSCO, Lilacs, PubMed and Science Direct, of different observational studies that performed a measurement of the treatment of glaucoma and to identify associated factors.

Results.
Atotal of 7 studies were selected that directly and indirectly measured adherence to glaucoma treatment. 
Differentrisk and protective factors for adherence to treatment were found. 
Theseshowed that African-American race, poor education, low personal income, and high treatment costs, are strongly related to poor adherence to treatment. 
Itwas also found that educational interventions and a good patient- physician relationship impacted positively on adherence.

Conclusion.
Theresults found are a guide for risk and protective factors for adherence to treatment of glaucoma. 
Itis cost effective to educate patients to positively impact adherence. 
Byidentifying such factors, attention can be focused on poor adherence patients.

Ourobjective is to describe a multifocal vitelliform presentation of Best's disease.
Thelesions in this disease may vary in size and shape, some may be a disc diameter in size, and often have some irregularity in their contour.
Thecase is described of a 21-year-old male patient referred to our ophthalmology department due to a <dis>progressive loss of vision</dis>.
Hispoor visual acuity was confirmed, and a complete examination was performed, in which macular flecks were observed, with yellow pigment arranged in oval distribution near their periphery. 
Dueto the suspicion of Best's multifocal disease, genetic tests were performed.
Multifocalvitelliform disease with the same features as those in Best's disease occurs most frequently in patients with a normal electro-oculogram (EOG), and a normal family history.
Conclusion
Best'smultifocal disease must be suspected in case of multiple vitelliruptive lesions close to the posterior pole. 
Genetictesting is essential for its diagnosis.Abstract
Background
Mycotickeratitis by moulds (MKM) is an important cause for <dis>corneal blindness</dis> and usually carries an unfavorable prognosis.
Aims
Thisstudy describes the risk factors and demographic and microbiological features of all MKM cases in Santa Lucía Ophthalmology Hospital during a period of 6 years.
Methods
Aprospective study was performed for all MKM cases diagnosed between October 2007 and September 2013.
Results
Among157 diagnosed cases, direct microscopic examination and culture were positive in 97 and 96% of the cases respectively.
MKMrepresents 17% of all microbiologically confirmed corneal abscesses.
Nosignificant differences were detected in annual MKM frequencies across the study period, suggesting that MKM incidence remains constant over time.
Amale-to-female ratio was observed (2.8:1); the most affected age groups ranged from 31 to 40 years old (males) and 61–70 years old (females).
Themost frequent predisposing factor was trauma (40%) followed by the use of contact lenses (9%), herpetic abscesses (5%) and diabetes (4%).
Thepredominant genera were _Fusarium_ (66%), _Aspergillus_ (10%), _Curvularia_ (6%) and _Alternaria_ (4%).
Themost frequent agent was _Fusarium solani_ species complex (52%).
Morethan two- thirds of the cases were produced by only 3 species or complexes.
However,at least 29 different species were detected in the remaining cases.
Thisis the first report of _Pholiota_ sp.
ascausative agent of human MKM.
Conclusions
Argentinalacks extensive epidemiological and clinical data on MKM.
Thissix- year study performed in Argentina is a first step leading to a better understanding of MKM epidemiology in our country.   Summary
Objectives
Todescribe the neuropsychological status of patients with intracranial aneurysms and to compare the cognitive status of patients with intracranial aneurysm treated by surgical or endovascular mehtods.
Materialand methods
Ninety-threecases with intracranial aneurysms treated with surgery (n = 56) or embolization (n = 37) were included.
Aneuropsychological assessment was applied to both groups retrospectively, at least one year after treatment.
Results
<dis>Neuropsychologicalimpairment</dis> was found in both groups.
35.7%of the patients treated with surgery and 43.2%, of those treated with embolization did <scp><neg>not</neg> show any <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
VisualMemory and Cued Recall of verbal information are better in patients treated by embolization.
Conclusions
Ourresults show that a large proportion of patients with intracranial aneurysms have <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> after treatment.
Endovascularmanagement may cause less <dis>impairment in visual and verbal memory</dis>.
However,bleeding may be the most important factor to explain these <dis>cognitive impairments</dis>.Abstract
Objective
Theaim of this study is to analyse the clinical findings and surgical results in a series of patients with bilateral chronic subdural haematoma (BCSDH), and compare the results with a series of patients treated for unilateral chronic subdural haematoma (UCSDH).
Patientsand methods
Aretrospective study was performed on 1523 patients diagnosed and surgically treated for chronic subdural haematoma over a period of 30 years.
Patientswere divided into 2 groups: The study group consisting of 190 patients operated on for a BCSDH and the control group consisting of patients operated on for an UCSDH (1333 cases).
Results
Thepatient series included 126 males (66.3%) and 64 females (33.7%), with a mean age at diagnosis of 74.8 ± 10.2.
Thecontrol group consisted of 870 males (65.2%) and 463 women (34.8%), with a mean age of 73.2 ± 12.1.
Themost common presenting symptoms was <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in 63 patients (33.2%) with BCSDH and 416 (29.5%) with UCSDH.
Recurrencerates were 9.4% (18 patients) and 5.7% (77 patients) in unilateral and bilateral haematomas, respectively.
Themortality was 10 patients (5.2%) with BCSDH and 55(4%) with UCSDH.
Factorssignificantly related to recurrence in the univariate analysis were being male ( _P_ =.040), anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy ( _P_ =.032), and poor neurological status at admission ( _P_ =.039).
Conclusions
Thisstudy indicates that BCSDH is more frequent in males, and the most common presentation is headache.
Themost important factors influencing recurrences are being male, intake of anticoagulant-antiaggregant drugs, and worse clinical status at admission.Abstract
Objective
Tomeasure recovery of independence in activities of daily living (ADL) 6 months after surgery in elderly patients (previously independent and <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>) with hip fracture caused by a fall.
Method
Weperformed a longitudinal, prospective cohort study of patients who were previously independent for ADL, or had mild dependence, and who showed <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
Consecutivesampling was performed.
Thevariables studied were age, sex, habitual residence, type of hip fracture, mental status (SPMSQ Pfeiffer), and independence in ADL (according to Barthel Index [BI]) prior to the fall and 6 months after the fall.
Results
Thestudy included 207 patients.
Therewas a predominance of female sex (74.4%) and pertrochanteric fractures (45.9%).
Themean age was 80.17 years old (SD = 6.95), and 7.7% were institutionalized.
Sixmonths after surgery, the mean BI score was 73.37 (SD = 26.76) (versus 90.05 before the fall), 16.8% showed urinary incontinence (versus 5.9%), 59.2% walked without assistance (versus 82.4%) and 24.6% climbed stairs unaided (versus 50.7%).
Theability to walk down the street was regained in 64.6% (versus 82.1% before the fall).
Recoveryof autonomy for ADL was statistically significantly lower in patients unable to walk outdoors, who were institutionalized or who had <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> before the fall.
Conclusions
Only33.6% of patients regained prior levels of autonomy 6 months after surgery.Abstract
Objective
Todetermine the quality of life of complex patients who were part of a case management program in Primary Health Care.
Materialand methods
Across-sectional descriptive study was conducted on complex patients who had <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp> selected by consecutive sampling, who were seen, during the last six months of the year 2010, in two Basic Health Areas on the Coast of Barcelona (Spain).
TheEuroQol test was administered as an individualised questionnaire.
Thevalues were assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) and EuroQol index, from the five key dimensions of the instrument.
Results
Fiftypatients with a mean age of 71.46 years, and 66% of whom were female, were included in the study.
Withinthe key dimensions, pain was the most important problem in 80% of cases, followed by mobility problems, activities of daily life and anxiety/depression problems in 62.5%, and finally, personal care problems in 47.5% of cases.
Theglobal values of EQ-VAS and EuroQol index were 51.89 (SD 21.19) and 0.53 (SD 0.26), respectively.
Theworst quality of life was detected in EQ-VAS and EuroQol Index for women, in situations of loneliness, co-morbidity, and with higher frequency of visits to hospital.
Inthe EQ-VAS, there was a tendency to score higher when older, and significantly less in case of the men living alone (EQ-EVA 36.67 ± 15.27) Conclusions
Complexpatients in our context have a worst quality of life than the general population in Catalonia older than 70 years old.
EuroQolis useful to perform comparisons between population groups.Abstract
Caregivers of people with <dis>autism spectrum disorder</dis> (<dis>ASD</dis>) are chronically exposed to high levels of stress.
Inturn, such stress is associated with high rates of negative health outcomes.
However,few studies have analyzed the effects of psychotherapeutic interventions in improving health in this population.
Themain aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral intervention program, based on the model proposed by Ruiz-Robledillo and Moya-Albiol (2014a).
Forthis, we used a sample of 17 informal caregivers of people diagnosed with <dis>ASD</dis>.
Thestudy was based on a pre-post design.
Caregivershad lower levels of burden immediately after the intervention than at baseline, while both immediately after the intervention and at 1 month of follow-up, they had fewer somatic symptoms, lower levels of depression, and better mood states than at baseline.
Theseresults provide evidence of the efficacy of the cognitive-behavioral intervention developed for reducing stress and health complaints in chronically stressed caregivers.
Additionally,the program could be useful in early stages of the caring process, to provide caregivers with effective skills for preventing future health problems.
Theintegration of the program in general psychosocial interventions would be highly beneficial for this population.Abstract
Introduction
Aattentionto the spiritual needs of patients and caregivers is important in the end of life quality care process.
Thisstudy aims to assess perception of spiritual care received by patients and main caregivers in a palliative care unit, and to compare this between groups: patient, caregiver during admission, and caregiver in follow-up.
Method
Adescriptive comparative cross-sectional study, using an _ad hoc_ questionnaire (items on emotional state, received spiritual attention and other resources), on a population of 219 users of a palliative care unit with a spiritual care service.
Entrycriteria: at least two days of admission, a first contact with the spiritual care provider, <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>, agreement to participate, and able to respond.
Participants
Atotal 145 users were preselected, with a final sample of 66 people (45.5% response rate); 56 (84.8%) were oncology patients; 38 (57.6%) women and 28 (42.4%) men.
Themean age was 76 years (standard deviation, 9).
Responserate; 36.7% patients (11), caregivers of admitted patients, 44.9% (22) and caregivers of follow up patients, 50% (33).
Reasonsfor rejection: 83.5% (66) refusal to participate, 8.9% (10) not contacted, and 3.8% (3) family did not allow it.
Results
Spiritualcare helped 88% to feel hopeful, 83% comforted, 79.1% to find meaning, and 73.4% to understand the meaning.
Almost all (95.2%) valued spiritual care in disease as necessary.
Conclusion
Althoughthe attempt to quantify the spiritual care substantially reduces its value, our data support the hypothesis that appropriate spiritual care improves the quality of the end of life stage experience and coping with death, and positively influences patient and family members.Abstract
Objective
Toanalyse, all phases of palliative sedation therapy (PST) procedure in our Palliative Care Unit, in patients who died during the palliative care process (PCP).
Method
Aretrospective and descriptive study was conducted.
Theclinical histories of patients admitted to a Chronic and Long Term Care Hospital in Valencia during the period from July 15, 2009 and June 15, 2010 were reviewed.
Thegeneral variables of the patients, as well as those specific to the PST, were analysed.
Thedata analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 statistical program.
Results
PSTwas performed on 51 patients (17.7% of deaths).
Themajority (76.5%) were over 64 years old, with an oncological disease (63%) and, on admission, total dependence (76.5%), and with a <dis>significant degree of cognitive impairment</dis> (65%) and malnutrition (84.5%).
Themost common refractory symptoms (RS) were: dyspnea (38.5%), pain (23%), non-specific suffering (23%), and agitation (20.5%).
Thesteps of PST that were recorded less frequently were: near death situation (37%), and intensity (41%), and the reason for the refractoriness (31%) of the RS.
Theinformed consent (IC) was given mostly by the family (83%), and on the same day the PST was started (81%).
Theuse of artificial hydration (AH) was low (12%).
Asa sedative drug was used in 96% of cases, Midazolam (MDZ) was the drug most used for sedation (96%), administered in the vast majority (98%) as a continuous and subcutaneous infusion.
Thefinal mean dose of MDZ was 28 mg/day.
Amajor opioid (100%) and an anticholinergic (68%) were associated with PST.
Dataon the PST monitoring had been recorded in 71% of patients, with acceptable control of the RS in 80% of cases.
Theaverage duration of the PST was 68 hours.
Non-oncologicalpatients (NO) with PST were less likely to be included in the PCP on admission, as well as being more dependent, and less likely to give IC, compared to oncological patients (O).
Conclusions
Thefrequency of use and duration of the PST and the RS and their control are within the ranges reported in the literature.
Itis almost exclusively performed with, and there is little use of AH.
Thereis still significant scope for improvement in certain steps of the PST.
Todo an Advance Care Planning before the last days of life would increase patient involvement in the IC for PST.
Thedifferences in the use of PST in oncological patients and non-oncological patients depends more on distinct clinic and care characteristics than that of the technique itself.Objective.

Abstract
Aims
Toassess the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of groups of key informants on adherence to treatment by polymedicated patients aged over 65 years following hospital discharge (internal medicine service).
Materialand methods
Qualitativeresearch study, based on focus groups and semi-structured interviews.
Thetarget population were patients prescribed 4 or more drugs prior to admission, self-sufficient and suffering <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
Keyareas assessed: hospital admission, hospital discharge, <dis>cognitive problems</dis>, attitudes that reduce adherence to treatment, and medication characteristics.
Results
Duringtheir hospitalization, patients lacked information on the condition that caused the admission, the treatment provided during hospitalization, and that prescribed following hospital discharge.
Athome, polymedication, drug accumulation, confusion about generic drugs, the complexity of the treatment regimen, treatment duplication, and a lack of coordination between hospital, primary healthcare and pharmacies, together with <dis>cognitive problems</dis>, negative attitudes and certain characteristics of the drugs prescribed, all decrease adherence to treatment.
Conclusions
Inview of the results obtained, it would be appropriate to increase patient knowledge about their condition on admission to hospital, as well as the treatment provided during hospitalization, and that prescribed after discharge.
Regardingattitudes, healthcare staff should better explain the treatment offered and adapt hospital discharge forms for these patients.
Interms of perceptions, steps should be taken to reduce negative attitudes and concerns that patients or caregivers may have about a drug, as these views could hinder adherence to treatment.Abstract
Because both the brain and craniofacial/limb features originate from the same germinal layer during early gestation, the postnatal presence of minor physical anomalies (MPAs) involving these physical features may be indicative of defects in prenatal neural migration and consequent brain abnormalities among individuals with psychosis.
However,to date it is unknown what symptoms and characteristics MPAs may be associated with, or how these markers may reflect vulnerability among adolescents at high-risk for developing psychosis.
Thisinformation is particularly vital for understanding susceptibility and informing etiological conceptualizations such as the neural diathesis-stress model.
Inthis study, 50 adolescents with a prodromal syndrome were evaluated for MPAs, salivary cortisol, auditory and visual memory function, and attenuated positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms.
Resultsindicated that the participants showing elevated MPAs (n = 25) were distinguished by elevated cortisol, <dis>deficit immediate and delayed visual memory</dis>, and higher levels of disorganized prodromal symptoms when compared with those participants exhibiting a lower incidence of MPAs.
Thiswas supported by supplementary correlational analyses examining the entire sample.
Thesefindings provide preliminary support for a theory that MPAs may reflect hippocampal system vulnerability among prodromal patients.Abstract
<dis>Cognitive dysfunction</dis> in major depressive disorder (MDD) spans multiple domains, including–but not limited to–executive function, verbal memory and attention.
Moreover,<dis>cognitive dysfunction</dis> is a common residual manifestation in depression and may persist during the remission phase of affective and somatic symptoms.
<dis>Cognitivedeficits</dis> can also prevent functional recovery, including the ability to work, and social and familar recovery.
Newantidepressants such as Vortioxetine seem to achieve a significant improvement in the cognitive domains that are altered in MDD, thus providing additional benefits over conventional and selective antidepressants.
Thegeneral objectives of this article are to critically assess the effects of available antidepressants and to discuss new therapeutic targets on <dis>neurocognitive dysfunction</dis> in MDD.Abstract
We report the case of a 90 year-old female patient treated at our health centre whose main symptom was the presence of isolated visual hallucinations.
Thesymptoms produced a state of intense concern to the patient and her family.
Theinitial assessment by the primary care unit showed that no acute pathology was affecting the patient.
So,the first option that was considered was <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and the patient was referred to the Area Dementia Unit to exclude this pathology.
However,after a neuropsychological examination, <scp><dis>dementia syndrome</dis> was <neg>ruled out</neg></scp>, and Charles Bonnet Syndrome, consisting of the appearance of visual hallucinations secondary to <dis>severe visual impairment</dis>, was considered instead.
Afterfive years, symptoms have almost completely disappeared and there are <scp><neg>no</neg> signs of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
Thisshows the need to consider Charles Bonnet Syndrome in the differential diagnosis of visual hallucinations in elderly patients in primary health care.Abstract
Glaucoma is the first cause of <dis>irreversible blindness</dis> worldwide.
Itsprevalence in our country is 2%; half of patients remain undiagnosed.
Certaindrugs can trigger and/or exacerbate glaucoma; hence the importance of having knowledge of these drugs by Primary Care physician.
Inaddition, the drugs used in the treatment of glaucoma, even topically, can have systemic side effects that should be also know to the Primary Care physician.
Anadequate knowledge of all the drug groups and the prescribing of the appropriate drug in patients with risk factors and underlying pathology, will enable the Primary Care physician to optimise the risk/benefit ratio in the therapeutic management of these patients.
Anupdate is presented on this ophthalmological disease, with special attention to its implications for pharmacological treatments.Abstract
Objectives
Toanalyse the case of a patient with a Psychotic Disorder and consumption of several drugs.
Materialand methods
Thecase of a 36 year old male with an affective schizophrenic disorder with 14 years of evolution and abuse of alcohol, xanthines and benzodiazepines is examined.
Adequatetreatment to stabilise the patient is carried out.
Results
Afteradmittance for desintoxication from the various substances, treatment is initiated with an atypical antipsychotic, an alcohol interdictor and a hypnotic to induce sleep.
Whileadmitted, the patient's evolution is adequate.
Follow-upwill continue in outpatients and periodic appointments.
Conclusions
Theexistence of an addiction together with a <dis>psychiatric disorder</dis> not related to the substances (dual diagnosis) is frequent.
Ithas been suggested that psychiatric patients with a history of abuse of/dependence on substances have a worse evolution of their disorder.
Nevertheless,if they maintain abstinence from the substances, the course of the illness may even become more benign than that of patients without a history of consumption.Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare entity with an invariably fatal course that progressively affects the central nervous system.
Itis caused by persistent infection with the wild-type measles virus.
Whilerare in industrial countries, it is not infrequent in developing countries, where there are still areas of endemic measles infection and immunization is not yet generalized.
Wedescribe an eight-year-old Spanish girl who presented rhythmic and symmetric myoclonus.
Shecontracted measles at 13 months and required hospitalization.
<scp><neg>No</neg><dis>cognitive deterioration</dis> was found</scp>.
Neuroimagingand the initial electroencephalogram were normal.
Oligoclonalbands and high titers of measles antibodies were found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid.
Shewas treated with oral metisoprinol and intraventricular alpha-interferon (IFN-a) and showed no further progression of her symptoms.
Theimportance of including SSPE in the differential diagnosis of patients consulting for school failure, neurological deterioration or <dis>movement disorders</dis> is highlighted.
Specialattention should be paid to the immigrant population from countries where the incidence of SSPE is greater than in Spain.Abstract
Introduction
Dravetsyndrome is a drug resistant epilepsy which starts in the first year of life with febrile seizures, followed by <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and epilepsy with multiple seizure types.
Diagnosishas been typically made at the age of three to four years, but earlier diagnosis is now possible as clinical features are better recognised and molecular diagnosis is available.
Patientsand methods
Westudied a series of 14 children with Dravet syndrome or Dravet spectrum epilepsy.
Ascreening test, developed by other authors to distinguish the febrile seizures in Dravet syndrome from febrile seizures from other origin, was applied to the clinical features of the seizures occurring during the first year of life in our patients.
Results
Clinicalsuspicion of Dravet spectrum epilepsy was possible in 100% of children in our series.
Moreover,taking into consideration only the first seizure, 79% of patients scored sufficiently to detect Dravet syndrome.
Conclusions
Dravetsyndrome can be recognised during the first year of life.
Itis important that physicians are made aware of these clinical criteria capable to distinguish febrile seizures in Dravet syndrome from febrile seizures of other origin, and set up a protocol to collect appropriate data regarding febrile seizures occurring in the first year of life.Abstract
Background and objective
Conventionalcytogenetics diagnoses 3-5% of patients with unexplained <dis>developmental delay</dis>/<dis>intellectual disability</dis> and/or multiple congenital anomalies.
TheMultiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification increases diagnostic rates from between 2.4 to 5.8%.
Currentlythe comparative genomic hybridisation array or aCGH is the highest performing diagnostic tool in patients with <dis>developmental delay</dis>/<dis>intellectual disability</dis>, congenital anomalies and <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis>.
Ouraim is to evaluate the efficiency of the use of aCGH as first-line test in these and other indications (epilepsy, short stature).
Patientsand method
Atotal of 1000 patients referred due to one or more of the abovementioned disorders were analysed by aCGH.
Results
Pathogenicgenomic imbalances were detected in 14% of the cases, with a variable distribution of diagnosis according to the phenotypes: 18.9% of patients with <dis>developmental delay</dis>/<dis>intellectual disability</dis>; 13.7% of multiple congenital anomalies, 9.76% of psychiatric pathologies, 7.02% of patients with epilepsy, and 13.3% of patients with short stature.
Withinthe multiple congenital anomalies, central nervous system abnormalities and congenital heart diseases accounted for 14.9% and 10.6% of diagnoses, respectively.
Amongthe <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis>, patients with <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis> accounted for 8.9% of the diagnoses.
Conclusions
Ourresults demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of aCGH as the first line test in genetic diagnosis of patients suspected of genomic imbalances, supporting its inclusion within the National Health System.Abstract
Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET) patients represent a significant percentage of the clinical cases in <dis>movement disorders pathologies</dis>, which prevents to the affected people leading a normal life.
A<dis>physical disability</dis> results and important social exclusion in many cases are produced.
Thetreatment methods are very differents, so it is critical hitting with the diagnosis in the early stages of these diseases.
Untiltoday, professionals and experts in medicine, use qualitative scales to differentiate pathology cases and its level of affectation.
Thesescales are used to follow up clinically and register the patient's history.
Thiswork proposes the use of binary classifiers focused on the Vector Support Machines (SVM) to obtain a differential diagnosis between the essential tremor and Parkinson's disease.Abstract
Lately, there have been a few studies warning about an increased risk of sudden death in patients with Parkinson's disease.
Wereport two men with Parkinson's disease with a disease duration of more than ten years.
Inthe first case, the subject was treated with L-dopa/carbidopa/entacapone, rasagiline, and amantadine.
Thesecond subject was treated with L-dopa/carbidopa, piribedil, and amantadine (in this case we had to perform an autopsy).
Wediscuss the causes of this phenomenon: sympathetic cardioselective neuronal degeneration, <dis>parasympathetic dysautonomia</dis>, and QTc interval prolongation by antiparkinsonian drugs.
Practicalapproaches are suggested for monitoring this group of patients until more data about the origin of this phenomenon is available.Abstract
Introduction
Limbicencephalitis may present with psychiatric symptoms, often reversible with treatment.
Casereport
Apreviously healthy teenager started with aggresiveness, disinhibition, hypersexuality, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and suicide attempts, for which she was treated with neuroleptics and benzodiazepines.
Twomonths later, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in both temporal lobes, suggestive of limbic encephalitis.
Biochemicaland radiologic studies ruled out neoplastic, inflammatory or infectious causes.
Shewas treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, high doses of intravenous steroids and cyclophosphamide, with notorious symptomatic and radiological improvement.
Conclusion
Consideringand treating patients with possible limbic encephalitis can radically change the prognosis, particularly in patients with psychiatric manifestations.Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in the elderly; its subtle clinical manifestations are very rarely recognized. 
Wepresent the case of a male patient, 81 years old, with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> due to drug-related vitamin B12 deficiency and possible chronic gastritis. 
Itis important to remember the most relevant causes of cobalamin deficiency in the clinical practice, the nervous system damage, and the <dis>cognitive domain impairments</dis> that occur with the mentioned damage. 
Itis necessary to make an early diagnosis and to institute prompt treatment; in practice the usual treatment is intramuscular, although several studies have shown the effectiveness of the oral treatment.Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that is characterized by the presence of bilateral schwannomas, meningiomas and gliomas. 
Thisis a case report of a woman of 34 years who has <dis>bilateral hipoacusia</dis>, <dis>left facial paralysis</dis> and consciousness loss in who it has been realized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and it has been found two mases scavenging contrast in the angle pontocerebellar. 
Ithas been established NF2 as presumptive diagnostic by diagnostic criteria. 
Thebigger lesion was resected surgically and it has been obtained histopathologic specimens that showed acoustic schwannomas.

Conclusion:The findings of MRI can be used as diagnostic method.
Posteriorreversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare disorder, associated with a variety of medical conditions and certain treatments. 
Itis characterized by edematous injuries mainly within the posterior cerebral white matter, and it is generally reversible by treating the underlying condition. 
Commonsymptoms are headaches, altered consciousness, and <dis>vision loss</dis>. 
Itis usually associated with malignant hypertension, pregnancy toxemia or use of immunosuppressive agents. 
Wedescribe the case of an HIV-positive patient in the context of increased blood pressure after cocaine use. 
PRESwas diagnosed through imaging studies, and both infectious and neoplastic causes were discarded. 
Cocaineuse was discontinued, and the patient was treated with a type ii angiotensin receptor antagonist, which allowed blood pressure control and complete reversal of symptoms.Abstract
Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia.
Becauseof its potentially serious clinical consequences (heart failure, stroke, and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>), atrial fibrillation has important socioeconomic and health implications.
Thisarticle reviews the major studies on the epidemiology of atrial fibrillation in Spain.
Recentdata suggest that in people older than 40 years, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation may be more than 4%.
Giventhe current Spanish demography, these data would imply that more than 1 million people in Spain have atrial fibrillation.Abstract
Purpose
Invivo study of retinal straylight in a patient before and after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP).
Methods
Retinalstraylight was measured in a 65-year-old man suffering from a post- herpetic corneal scar, both before and after PKP using the compensation comparison method (C-Quant straylight meter, Oculus GmbH, Germany).
Results
Retinalstraylight values before surgery were high compared to those obtained for age-matched normals in previous studies, due to light scattering induced by the corneal scar.
Meanand standard deviation straylight values before and 9 months after PKP were log(s)=1.71±0.09 and 1.05±0.08, respectively.
Decreasein retinal straylight could be explained by an improved corneal transparency, resulting in a significant improvement in visual acuity.
Conclusions
Retinalstraylight measurement provides objective and clinically valuable information about forward light scattering as the cause of <dis>visual disability</dis>.
Improvementof the visual function after surgery is underestimated by visual acuity measures.Abstract
Purpose
Todetermine the prevalence of <dis>visual impairment</dis> attributable to refractive error and other causes in a youthful Ghanaian population.
Methods
Aprospective survey of all consecutive visits by first-year tertiary students to the Optometry clinic between August, 2013 and April, 2014.
Ofthe 4378 first-year students aged 16–39 years enumerated, 3437 (78.5%) underwent the eye examination.
Theexamination protocol included presenting visual acuity (PVA), ocular motility, and slit-lamp examination of the external eye, anterior segment and media, and non-dilated fundus examination.
Pinholeacuity and fundus examination were performed when the PVA ≤ 6/12 in one or both eyes to determine the principal cause of the <dis>vision loss</dis>.
Results
Themean age of participants was 21.86 years (95% CI: 21.72–21.99).
Theprevalence of <dis>bilateral visual impairment</dis> (<dis>BVI</dis>; PVA in the better eye ≤6/12) and <dis>unilateral visual impairment</dis> <dis>UVI</dis>; PVA in the worse eye ≤6/12) were 3.08% (95% CI: 2.56–3.72) and 0.79% (95% CI: 0.54–1.14), respectively.
Among106 participants with <dis>BVI</dis>, refractive error (96.2%) and corneal opacity (3.8%) were the causes.
Ofthe 27 participants with <dis>UVI</dis>, refractive error (44.4%), maculopathy (18.5%) and retinal disease (14.8%) were the major causes.
Therewas unequal distribution of <dis>BVI</dis> in the different age groups, with those above 20 years having a lesser burden.
Conclusion
Eyescreening and provision of affordable spectacle correction to the youth could be timely to eliminate <dis>visual impairment</dis>.Abstract
Purpose
Mostcauses of <dis>childhood blindness</dis> are treatable or preventable.
Knowledgeof parents’ awareness and perception of eye problems is important in helping to understand parents’ eye care seeking behavior.
Thisunderstanding becomes necessary as early detection and intervention can be effective when done at an early age.
Method
Studywas carried out in Benin City, Nigeria.
Thirty-fiveparents aged 38–54 years with a mean age of 43(±2) years were recruited.
Twentysix were females and nine males.
Teneye care practitioners aged 30–45 years with a mean age of 40 (±2) were included.
Sevenwere males and three were females.
Datawas analyzed qualitatively and in percentages.
Results
Majorityof parents were aware of common eye problems: Blurry vision (85.7%), measles in eye (48.5%), cataract (74.3%), conjunctivitis (48.5%), itching and redness (74.3%), crossed eyes (34.3%), strabismus (57.1%), short sightedness (48.5%) and stye or hordeolum (57.1%).
Toomuch carbohydrate, night reading and too much TV were some of the reasons given for bad eyesight.
Selfmedication and use of local remedies for treatment of conjunctivitis was common practice (94.3%).
Chloramphenicoleyedrop was the most common drug used for any eye problem before visiting a doctor (80.0%).
Conclusion
Parentsare aware of common eye diseases in children but have wrong perception of their causes.
Programsto increase public awareness of causes of eye problems and harmful effects of self medication are advocated for to expose inherent dangers.Abstract
Objective
Alzheimer'sdisease has been studied from various areas of knowledge (biomarkers, brain structure, behavior, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>).
Ouraim was to examine the effects of an exercises protocol developed using complexity theory concepts.
Method
Exerciseimproves neuroplasticity (neuronal ability to change and adapt as a result of experience) through mental and physical skills linked to cognitive- associative brain circuits.
Introducingcontrolled physical and cognitive stimuli, self-organization and connectivity among brain systems enhance.
Weused tasks with non-linear outputs (several solutions) and learning as order parameter.
Taskswere performed simultaneously, at the edge of the error seeking self-organized criticality.
Results
Screeningtests data showed a reduction in <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, which suggests a reduction disease progression, in terms of executive function.
Therewas a marked improvement in the physical tests: 30 seconds chair stand test (PRE: 8.78 ± 3.46; POST: 9.44 ± 3.68 repetitions) and foot up and go test (PRE: 11.95 ± 5.19; POST: 11.69 ± 4.43 seconds).
Conclusion
Resultsshowed that patient's self-organization was increased; behaviors atrophied or inhibited reappeared.
Usingthese controlled perturbations, Alzheimer's Disease patients were able to manifest improvements in both their mental and physical abilities.Abstract
Introduction and objectives
Haemorrhoidsare a frequent complaint that can be treated with homeopathy, but effectiveness of this treatment has not been evaluated.
Theaim was to evaluate the effectiveness of treating haemorrhoids with homeopathic treatment (intervention group) compared to usual care (control group).
Methods
Anon-randomised, controlled, prospective study was conducted on patients (> 18 years, <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>) with haemorrhoids, of which 21 were assigned to receive usual care and 32 homeopathic treatment, on the basis of their preference and regular practice in 14 community pharmacies in Girona, Spain (May-August 2013).
Atbaseline, 15 days, and 30 days, pain and itch were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS), and quality of life was measured using the EUROQoL-5D and VAS.
Results
Theusual care patients were more likely to be using other treatments for haemorrhoids at baseline ( _P_ < .05).
Bothgroups showed a general improvement in the symptoms.
Nostatistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of relief of itching, reduction in the level of pain, or improvement in the quality of life.
Statisticalpower was only adequate in the analysis of the reduction of pain.
Only55% of patients suffering the condition for more than 10 years had visited a physician for their haemorrhoids.
Conclusions
Thesample size was limited and there were confounding factors (use of other medications) that may have limited the possibility of detecting differences.
Randomisedcontrolled studies, with a longer follow-up period and a larger sample size, should be carried out before making systematic recommendations concerning these treatments.Introduction.
Ahigh comorbidity has been observed among <dis>attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</dis> (<dis>ADHD</dis>) and <dis>categorical personality disorders</dis> (<dis>PD</dis>). 
Astudy is conducted on the dimensional traits associated with <dis>ADHD</dis> and <dis>PD</dis>, in order to determine whether there are any differences.

Methodology.
Across-sectional study was conducted on 78 outpatients attending a Mental Health Clinic in Arganda (Madrid) from January 2013 to June 2015. 
ADHDdiagnosis was evaluated with the CAARS, the CAADID, and the WURS scales, and the <dis>PD</dis> with the SCID-II-DSM-IV questionnaire. 
Noneof the patients were receiving any stimulant or atomoxetine before the study, and all patients signed the informed consent before the study.

Results.
Ahigh comorbidity was found with all <dis>PD</dis> clusters, especially with hyperactive and combined type <dis>ADHD</dis>. 
<dis>DepressivePD</dis> was associated with inattentive <dis>ADHD</dis>.

Conclusions.
Inspite of using a questionnaire to evaluate <dis>PD</dis>, some differences can be observed between specific <dis>ADHD</dis> types and <dis>PD</dis>. 
Morestudies are needed to investigate dimensional personality traits in order to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics goals.
Abstract
Introduction and goals
Wehave studied the relationship between the minimum stapedial reflex thresholds induced by means of the intra-operative stimulation of the cochlear implant and the post-operative thresholds of highest auditory comfort level.
Methods
Wehave assessed the maximum auditory comfort at the end of the first and second quarters following activation of the cochlear implant, by which time the strategy for codification of the stimuli and the programming map are considered to be already stable.
Thestudy was carried out at our cochlear implants unit.
Allthe patients in the study had <dis>bilateral sensorineural deafness</dis> of varying aetiology and, following our standardized battery of diagnostic tests, were considered to be good candidates for cochlear implant.
Allaspects of the surgical technique were kept the same in order to be able to compare the results better.
Allmembers of the study were fitted with at least one Nucleus Freedom implant with Contour Advance Electrode.
Results
Thisstudy has been carried out on 24 cochlear implants placed in 22 patients younger than 14 years old.
Conclusions
Afterassessing our experience, we can conclude that, in the Nucleus Freedom with Contour Advance Electrode cochlear implant, there is a positive statistical relationship between the levels of acoustic reflex induction obtained at the peri-operative stage and the levels of maximum auditory comfort, as determined by behavioural observation techniques for each of the different electrodes, in children up to 14 years old.Abstract
Case report
A61-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 7 years for which she was prescribed insulin therapy.
Rosiglitazone(4mg once daily) was introduced with adequate blood glucose control.
Onemonth later, she presented with complaints of systemic oedema and <dis>loss of vision</dis>.
Fundoscopyshowed bilateral macular oedema.
Asystemic study demonstrated peripheral oedema.
Rosiglitazonewas stopped and she was managed conservatively with a rapid resolution of the oedemas and at fundus examination there was no decrease in the macular oedema.
Discussion
Thiscase reminds us of the importance of identifying potential toxicities of glitazone regimens.
Glitazoneuse appears to be a cause of macular oedema, and stopping the drug may not resolve this oedema.Abstract
Case report
A33-year-old female with a large, unilateral, dark tumor of the optic disk with a presumed diagnosis of melanocytoma.
Aftera follow-up of nineteen years, the tumor produced massive intraocular seeding with cataract, secondary glaucoma (pigmentary, melanocytomalytic, inflammatory and pupillary seclusion glaucoma) and amaurosis.
Theeye is enucleated and the pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis.
Discussion
Opticdisk melanocytoma is a benign stationary tumor.
However,sometimes there are complications, including <dis>visual loss</dis>.
Ourcase confirms that vitreous seeding is due to tumor necrosis with dissemination of tumoral debris and melanin, which are phagocytized by macrophages and produce an inflammatory reaction, trabecular plugging and ocular hypertension.Abstract
Case report
An85 year old male suffered <dis>vision loss</dis> in both eyes due to ruptured bilateral retinal arterial macroaneurysms.
Discussion
Wereport this unusual case and show the importance of studying these types of patients in order to detect associated systemic diseases.Abstract
Clinical case
Wereport a case of a 31-year-old woman with a <dis>sudden visual loss</dis> due to a cilioretinal artery occlusion.
Thephysical examination showed hepatomegaly.
Serumiron and ferritin and transferrin saturation were unusually high.
TheDoppler scan of carotid arteries showed no relevant signs of atheromatous disease.
Dilatedcardiomyopathy was revealed in the B-scan with subendocardial calcium deposits.
Genetictests were positive for hemochromatosis.
Discussion
Subendocardialcalcification due to hemochromatosis could be the embolic source in our patient.
Thisembolic ocular disease is the first presentation of hemochromatosis in this patient.Introduction
Glaucomais a chronic asymptomatic disease, progressing to <dis>loss of vision</dis>. 
Elevatedintraocular pressure is the only modifiable factor. 
Adherenceto glaucoma treatment varies from 2 to 80%.
Objective
Toevaluate factors associated with adherence to topical glaucoma treatment reported in the literature, and to identify protective factors and risk factors, as well as modifiable and non-modifiable factors, in order to take them into account to perform interventions in adherence.
Materialsand methods
Abibliographic search of articles published in the last 8 years in databases such as Clinical Key, Cochrane (OVID), EBSCO, Lilacs, PubMed and Science Direct, of different observational studies that performed a measurement of the treatment of glaucoma and to identify associated factors.
Results
Atotal of 7 studies were selected that directly and indirectly measured adherence to glaucoma treatment. 
Differentrisk and protective factors for adherence to treatment were found. 
Theseshowed that African-American race, poor education, low personal income, and high treatment costs, are strongly related to poor adherence to treatment. 
Itwas also found that educational interventions and a good patient–physician relationship impacted positively on adherence.
Conclusion
Theresults found are a guide for risk and protective factors for adherence to treatment of glaucoma. 
Itis cost effective to educate patients to positively impact adherence. 
Byidentifying such factors, attention can be focused on poor adherence patients.Abstract
Introduction
RBANSis a short neuropsychological battery which has shown to be sensitive in detecting <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in degenerative and non-degenerative diseases.
Ithas been translated and adapted to different languages and is widely used in other countries, but no Spanish version has been published.
Theobjective was to make a valid translation of the RBANS to Spanish, and obtain a version adapted to the Spanish population.
Patientsand methods
Thestudy included 73 subjects: 25 males with a mean age of 54 years and 9.72 years of education, and 48 females with a mean age of 53 years and 10.29 years of education.
Thebattery was translated using the translation-back- translation method (with slight differences), followed by a descriptive pilot study in a sample of the normal population.
Results
Anoverall reliability coefficient with a Cronbach alpha of 0.73 was obtained in the translation and adaptation of the RBANS, form A (1998).
Statisticallysignificant positive correlations between the indices were obtained.
Conclusions
Theversion translated and adapted to Spanish performs similarly to the original version.Abstract
Introduction
About20% to 26% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) show alterations in visuospatial/visuoconstructive (VS–VC) skills even though temporo-parieto- occipital impairment is a frequent finding in magnetic resonance imaging.
Nostudies have specifically analysed the relationship between these functions and lesion volume (LV) in these specific brain areas.
Objective
Toevaluate the relationship between VS–VC impairment and magnetic resonance imaging temporo-parieto-occipital LV with subcortical atrophy in patients with MS.
Methodology
Of100 MS patients undergoing a routine neuropsychological evaluation, 21 were selected because they displayed VS–VC impairments in the following tests: incomplete picture, block design (WAIS-III), and Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test.
Wealso selected 13 MS patients <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp> (control group).
RegionalLV was measured in FLAIR and T1-weighted images using a semiautomated method; subcortical atrophy was measured by bicaudate ratio and third ventricle width.
Partialcorrelations (controlling for age and years of schooling) and linear regression analysis were employed to analyse correlations between magnetic resonance imaging parameters and cognitive performance.
Results
Allmeasures of LV and brain atrophy were significantly higher in patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
RegionalLV, bicaudate ratio, and third ventricle width are significantly and inversely correlated with cognitive performance; the strongest correlation was between third ventricle width and VC performance (block design: _P_ = .001; Rey–Osterrieth complex figure: _P_ < .000).
Inthe multivariate analysis, third ventricle width only had a significant effect on performance of VC tasks (block design: _P_ = .000; Rey–Osterrieth complex figure: _P_ = .000), and regional FLAIR VL was linked to the VS task (incomplete picture; _P_ = .002).
Conclusions
Measuresof subcortical atrophy explain the variations in performance on visuocostructive tasks, and regional FLAIR VL measures are linked to VS tasks.Introduction
Alzheimerdisease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder which eventually results in <dis>total intellectual disability</dis>. 
Thehigh global prevalence and the socioeconomic burden associated with the disease pose major challenges for public health in the 21st century. 
Inthis review we focus on both existing treatments and the therapies being developed, which principally target the β-amyloid protein.
Discussion
Theamyloidogenic hypothesis proposes that β-amyloid plays a key role in AD. 
Severalpharmacological approaches aim to reduce the formation of β-amyloid peptides by inhibiting the β-secretase and γ-secretase enzymes. 
Inaddition, both passive and active immunotherapies have been developed for the purpose of inhibiting β-amyloid peptide aggregation.
Conclusions
Progressin identifying the molecular basis of AD may provide better models for understanding the causes of this neurodegenerative disease. 
Thelack of efficacy of solanezumab (a humanised monoclonal antibody that promotes β-amyloid clearance in the brain), demonstrated by 2 recent Phase III clinical trials in patients with mild AD, suggests that the amyloidogenic hypothesis needs to be revised.Abstract
Objective
Toevaluate the patterns of cerebral cortical distribution of 11C-PIB in patients with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>).
Materialand methods
Thestudy included 69 patients (37 male, age range 42–79 years) with <dis>MCI</dis>, sub- classified as 53 with <dis>amnestic-MCI</dis> (<dis>A-MCI</dis>), and 16 with <dis>non-amnestic-MCI</dis> (<dis>NA- MCI</dis>).
Patientsunderwent 11C-PIB PET/CT scan 60 min after intravenous injection of the radiotracer.
Avisual analysis of the images was performed by 2 experienced physicians.
11C-PIB-positivestudies were considered when gray matter uptake was equal to or greater than white matter.
Accordingto the regions involved, 11C-PIB-positive studies were classified into A-pattern (predominant retention in frontal, anterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and basal ganglia) and B-pattern (generalized retention).
Results
Thirty-nineof the 69 (56%) patients with <dis>MCI</dis> showed 11C-PIB retention.
Ofthe 53 <dis>A-MCI</dis> patients, 36 (68%) showed 11C-PIB retention.
Elevenout of 36 (30%) positive scans in <dis>A-MCI</dis> patients showed A-pattern, and 25 out of 36 (70%) patients had a B-pattern.
Positive11C-PIB was observed in 3 out of 16 (19%) patients with <dis>NA-MCI</dis>.
Regionaldistribution in these 3 patients showed A-pattern in 1, and B-pattern in 2 patients.
Conclusion
Corticalretention of 11C-PIB was more frequent in <dis>A-MCI</dis> than in <dis>NA-MCI</dis> patients, and also B-pattern than A-pattern in the 11C-PIB positive group.
Therecognition of 11C-PIB distribution patterns allows <dis>MCI</dis> patients to be classified, and the A-pattern may offer a therapeutic window for potential future treatments.Objectives
Corticalposterior hypometabolism on PET imaging with 18F-FDG (FDG-PET), and altered levels of Aß1-42 peptide, total Tau (tTau) and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are established diagnostic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Anevaluation has been made of the concordance and relationship between the results of FDG-PET and CSF biomarkers in symptomatic patients with suspected AD.
Materialand methods
Aretrospective review was carried out on 120 patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> referred to our Cognitive Neurology Unit, and who were evaluated by brain FDG-PET and a lumbar puncture for CSF biomarkers. 
Inorder to calculate their Kappa coefficient of concordance, the result of the FDG-PET and the set of the three CSF biomarkers in each patient was classified as normal, inconclusive, or AD-compatible. 
Therelationship between the results of both methods was further assessed using logistic regression analysis, including the Aß1-42, tTau and pTau levels as quantitative predictors, and the FDG-PET result as the dependent variable.
Results
Theweighted Kappa coefficient between FDG-PET and CSF biomarkers was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.35-0.57). 
Logisticregression analysis showed that the Aß1-42 and tTau values together were capable of discriminating an FDG-PET result metabolically suggestive of AD from one non-suggestive of AD, with a 91% sensitivity and 93% specificity at the cut-off line Aß1-42=44+1.3×tTau.
Conclusions
Thelevel of concordance between FDG-PET and CSF biomarkers was moderate, indicating their complementary value in diagnosing AD. 
TheAß1-42 and tTau levels in CSF help to predict the patient FDG-PET cortical metabolic status.Abstract
Background
Retrospectiveand prospective randomized studies have compared general and locoregional anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy, but without definitive results.
Objectives
Evaluatethe incidence of complications (medical, surgical, neurological, and hospital mortality) in a tertiary center in Portugal and review the literature.
Method
Retrospectiveanalysis of patients undergoing endarterectomy between 2000 and 2011, using a software for hospital consultation.
Results
Atotal of 750 patients were identified, and locoregional anesthesia had to be converted to general anesthesia in 13 patients.
Thus,a total of 737 patients were included in this analysis: 74% underwent locoregianal anesthesia and 26% underwent general anesthesia.
Therewas no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups regarding perioperative variables.
Theuse of shunt was more common in patients undergoing general anesthesia, a statistically significant difference.
Thedifference between groups of strokes and mortality was not statistically significant.
Theaverage length of stay was shorter in patients undergoing locoregional anesthesia with a statistically significant difference.
Conclusions
Wefound that our data are overlaid with the literature data.
Afterreviewing the literature, we found that the number of studies comparing locoregional and general anesthesia and its impact on delirium, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, and decreased quality of life after surgery is still very small and can provide important data to compare the 2 techniques.
Thus,some questions remain open, which indicates the need for randomized studies with larger number of patients and in new centers.Abstract
Introduction
Tuberoussclerosis (TS) is an inherited disorder with multisystemic involvement and a high phenotypic variability.
Thereare two genes that cause this condition: TSC1 and TSC2.
Objectives
Ourgoal was to clinically characterise patients with TS followed up in the Pediatric Neurology Clinic of a tertiary hospital during the last 10 years, and correlate the genotype with the severity of neurological manifestations and imaging studies.
Patientsand methods
Retrospectiveanalysis of patients with TS, including review of medical records and available MRI imaging.
Results
Westudied 35 cases with a median age at diagnosis of 10 months.
Seizureswere the first manifestation in 91.4% of cases, with a predominance of epileptic spasms.
Over50% had <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and 49% <dis>behavioural disorders</dis>.
Agenetic study was performed on 24 children, and TSC2 mutations identified in 58.3% of them.
Ofthe 11 cases of refractory epilepsy, six had the TSC2 gene mutation.
Inthe group of eight patients with <dis>moderate/severe cognitive deficits</dis>, five had TSC2 mutations.
Wereviewed 26 MRI scans, in which it was observed that 76.9% had diffuse involvement of cerebral lobes, which reflects a greater burden of injury.
Ofthe patients who had an MRI scan performed and had TSC2 mutations, all had a high tuber load, and 5 of them had refractory epilepsy.
Discussion
Inour sample we observe a high percentage of mutations in the TSC2 gene.
Thismutation carries a worse neurological prognosis, with drug-resistant epilepsy and a more severe <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.Abstract
The social significance of the rights of patients has produced in Spain a diffuse legislative enactment since 2000 that culminated with the drafting of the living will document, or advanced directives.
Thebasis of this document is the recognition of the autonomy of the patient.
Thisrespect goes beyond the competencies of the patient by enabling clinical situations to be anticipated and related decisions to be taken in advance.
Livingwill is a written document that reflects an act of personal responsibility.
Itis a tool for making clinical decisions that is particularly applicable to chronic patients susceptible of developing <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and a state of dependency.
Healthprofessionals should be aware of current legislation on the principle of autonomy, and must make their patients aware of the option to implement this procedure.
Aneducational and public awareness campaign aimed at professionals and the general public is required.
