Abstract
 The auditory training with wide-band white noise is a methodology for the qualitative recovery of the <dis>hearing loss</dis> in people suffering from <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
It is based on the application of a wide-band modified noise which we will call "K-noise".
The auditory trainer GAES 100 KT is a voice amplifier device with earphone outlets.
It incorporates a wide-band noise generator which produces a noise that is a mixture of all the audibles frequencies.
Therefore, it estimulates all the sensory cells in the organ of Corti, but from 1000 Hz it has a progressive fall towards the high pitch of 6 db per octave.
This device consists of a series of controls which make possible to apply both the noise and the phonetic materials -texts and words lists that the therapist´s voice presents- to either one of the ears or to both of them, in diffferent intensities and for different periods of time.
In this first article of our study of the auditory training with wide-band white noise we will review the different methods of hearing training and present not only the basic concepts on auditory training, but also the systematic we have followed to apply it.Abstract
The auditory training with wide-band white noise is a methodology for the qualitative recovery of the <dis>hearing loss</dis> in people suffering from <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
It is based on the application of a wide-band white modified noise.
In a prospective study, we have assessed the modifications of the verbal reception threshold URV), the maximum discrimination (Dmax), and the discrimination coefficient (Kd) in a sample of 48 patients, who have followed a program of 15 auditory training with wide- band white noise sessions.
The average improvements of the verbal discrimination variables expressed in percentage are 4.23% for the URV, a 9.04% for the kd, a 17.87% for the Dmax, and 4.32%, 10.05%, 13.04% for the binaural URV, Kd and Dmax respectively.
From our results, it can be deduced that the auditory training with wide-band white noise improves the verbal discrimination measures.
Not only it allows to reach the verbal reception threshold at a lower intensity, but also it moves the discrimination line towards the left.
Furthermore, it increases the maximum discrimination both in binaural measurements and in those which consider all the ears.Abstract
The aim of this study was to examine the results of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (Teoae) as screening test for <dis>hearing impairment</dis> in newborn infants.
We examined 9.951 of 11.405 infants born in our city from January 1st, (1995), to December 31st, (1998).
A Teoae test was performed prior to discharge and repeated one week later in cases who failed the first Teoae.
In case of suspected <dis>hearing loss</dis> auditory brainstem response (Abr) was performed 3 months later.
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> was defined as Abr threshold >20 Db.
157 infants (1,5%) were identified with <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Screening with Teoae was sufficiently sensitive in identification of <dis>congenital hearing impairment</dis> and the efficacy increased with the experience.Abstract
 The auditory training with wide-band white noise is a methodology for the qualitative recovery of the <dis>hearing loss</dis> in people suffering from <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
It is based on the application of a wide-band white modified noise.
In a prospective study, we have assessed the modifications of the recruitment coefficient in a sample of 48 patients who have followed a program of 15 auditory training with wide- band white noise sessions.
The average improvement of the recruitment coefficient expressed in percentage is a 7.7498%, which comes up to 23.5249% in the case of a binaural recruitment coefficient.
From our results, it can be deduced that the auditory training with wide-band white noise reduces the recruitment.
That is to say, the decrease of the recruitment in high intensities both binaurally and in all ears.Abstract
The auditory training with wide-band white noise is a methodology for the qualitative recovery of the <dis>hearing loss</dis> in people suffering from <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
It is based on the application of a wide-band white modified noise.
In a prospective study, we have assessed the modifications of the total auditory threshold (UAt), the conversational auditory threshold (UAc), and the pain threshold (Ud) in a sample of 48 patients, who have followed a program of 15 auditory training with wide-band white noise sessions.
The average improvements of the variables expressed in percentage are 0.78% for the UAt, 0.64% for the UAc, and 5.31% for the Ud.
From our results, it can be deduced that the auditory training with wideband white noise does not modify the pure tone thresholds, but it moves the pain threshold towards higher intensities, enlarging the dinamic auditory field.Abstract
We report on nine cases with jugular dehiscence in middle ear diagnosticated and followed up in our clinic from 1987 to 2000.
Diagnosis was made, in some cases, when carrying out an otoscopy and others by clinical sintomatology, otomicroscopically imaging, audiometry, ct-scan and mri.
All patients were affected of <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Some of them also suffered pulsatile tinnitus and even vertigo.
The follow up of all patients has been stable and devoid of bleeding complications
Abstract
An hemorheological study on whole blood filterability (wbf) was done in eleven patients bearing of <dis>sudden deafness</dis>, in a continuous way, even before clinical onset.
This evaluation is making usually in animal models, but not in humans.
Independently of clinical diagnosis of each patient (two cases of diabetes mellitus, one of ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic hypertension, after blood transfusion, sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation, upper respiratory ways infection, after surgery, and two healthy individuals), all of them showed a decresed wbf when <dis>hearing loss</dis> appeared (from 19,97±1,15 ?l/sec to 16,87±1,21 ?l/sec).
This value normalized at six or seven days from the onset in cases with some kind of hearing recovery (18,83±1,01 ?l/sec, n=4), but did not in those with no improvement even at thirty days (17,39±0,77 ?l/sec, n=7).
There were differences in wbf values of patients with and without hearing recovery in determinations at seven and thirty days from onset.
Decrease in wbf accompanies this <dis>hearing disorder</dis> and confirms the cochlear microcirculation susceptibility to the impairment of blood viscoelastic properties.
Abstract
 We show two atypical Cogan’s syndrome cases in forty-seven and fifty-six years old individuals.
Characteristical symptoms of the syndrome were detected in both (interstitial keratitis, <dis>sensorineural deafness</dis> and vestibular dysfunction), but they could be considered as unusual because of the association of sistematic symptoms and an onset with <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
In both cases there was an increase in erythrosedimentation rate and immunoglobulins leveles, as well as high titles for rheumatoid factor and non-specific autoantibodies.
By means of a Western-blot technique, several choclear antibodies with distinct molecular weight were detected, but the 68 KD appeared in both.
Metil-prednisolone treatmen did not avoid ocular and auditive reactivation in ne of the patients.Abstract
 A69-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of <dis>dysphagia</dis> and a hard overgrowth of the right palatine tonsil visible in oral examination.
Computerized Tomography scan showed a big calcified lesion inside the tonsil not seen in a pharyngoscopy.
Tonsillectomy was performed and a giant tonsillolith was found inside the resected piece.
The calculus was 3x2x2.3 cm and with an irregular-pyramidal shape.
Normal tonsillar tissue with many colonies of Actionomyces inside the tonsillar crypts was the definitive pathological feature.Abstract
 Diabetes mellitus is considered a risk factor for <dis>sensorineural sudden deafness</dis>.
Its pathogenesis remains unknown.
However, the physiopathological implication of a hyperviscosity syndrom in diabetics and patients bearing of <dis>sudden deafness</dis> can mean the nexus between the two entities.
Total blood viscosity and erythrocyte adhesion were haemorheological parameters significatively higher in blood of diabetics with <dis>sudden deafness</dis> than in normal hearing controls.
Moreover, erythrocyte filterability and deformability were lower in diabetics, but it was not statistically significative.
These findings help to guide therapy in these patients towards specific measures to improve blood viscoelastic properties.Abstract
 We report two cases of <dis>sudden deafness</dis> which appeared during vaso-occlusive crisis of a sickle cell anaemia (homozygous form of disease) and a sickle cell trait (heterozygous form) in two males aged sixteen and twenty-two, respectively.
A high erythrocyte aggregability and low deformability were proved in both young men.
Although <dis>hearing disorders</dis> have been reported in this disease, a sudden onset is not common.
The treatment used was useful in the removal of painful crisis and infections, but <dis>deafness</dis> did not improve in either of then.Abstract
 Susac’s syndrome is an extremely rare clinical manifestation characterized by the triad of <dis>fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, <dis>sudden visual loss</dis> and encephalopathy.
Probably subdiagnosed, it affects young women who start the clinical history with headache, <dis>visual and hearing disturbances</dis>, with neurological findings in MRI.
With unknown aetiology, pathogenesis is based on arteriolar microinfarcts in retina, cochlea, and grey and white matter in the brain.
Treatment is, as stated in the bibliography and our experience, intravenous high doses of steroids followed by oral steroids together with hyperbaric oxygen to minimize ischaemic lesions.
Aspirin associatet to nimodipin has been useful to date in the treatment of our patient.
We present a case and review the existing literature.Abstract
 This report describes a patient with Von Hippel-Lindau disease revealed by an endolymphatic sac tumor.
Endolymphatic sac tumor (EST) was only recently recognized as a manifestation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.
EST are vascular lesions that destroy and expand bone.
We report a recently treated case of an EST.
A 30-year-old woman presented with otalgia and <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed typical features of an EST.
We checked for VHL and found this disease in the patient.
VHL disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene.
A molecular diagnosis of VHL is nowadays available, and this has change the clinical management of patients and their families.
Diagnosis of VHL has to be suspected in patients with a VHL-related tumor without familial history and especially in those cases of hemangioblastoma or endolymphatic sac tumors.
Such patients should be systematically investigated for clinical and molecular evidence of VHL disease.Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Sensorineural deafness</dis> is a very common disorder in humans, which affects approximately 10% of the population.
Genetic causes are suggested to be responsible for more than half of the cases.
The A1555G mutation in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene and the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene are the most common mutations for <dis>sensorineural deafness</dis> in the Spanish population.
Methods
A genetic study was carried out in order to determine the frequency of the mutations A1555G in the mitochondrial DNA and 35delG in the connexin-26 gene in 21 patients from 21 non-consanguineous unrelated families affected by <dis>late- onset bilateral non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss</dis> from Cantabria.
Results
The A1555G mutation was found in 6 patients.
Five of these 6 patients had been treated with aminoglycosides.
In all of them the <dis>auditory impairment</dis> affected mainly the high frequencies.
The 35delG mutation was not found in any of the patients.
Conclusions
The A1555G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA has been found to be the most common amongst the Cantabrian population.
The A1555G mutation should be suspected in those members of families affected by <dis>sensorineural hearing impairment</dis> with a maternal inheritance pattern and ototoxicity from treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics.
The 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene does not seem to be a major cause of <dis>deafness</dis> in families with <dis>late-onset non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss</dis> in our area.Abstract
 Objective
To examine the audiometric patterns of familial <dis>hearing impairment</dis> due to the A1555G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA.
Patients and methods
We includ 55 subjects with the A1555G mutation from 6 unrelated families, affected by <dis>nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss</dis> and residing in Cantabria.
The A1555G mutation was found in homoplasmy in all the families, except in one family, in which it was in heteroplasmy.
Aside from standard history taking and general otolaryngological examination, pure tone audiometry was carried out in all patients.
Results
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> was developed by most of the patients.
The auditory defect was a <dis>slowly progressive bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, affecting mainly the high frequencies.
In patients in which aminoglycoside ototoxicity could be excluded, <dis>hearing loss</dis> usually ranged from mild to moderate, with a late onset.
In 17 cases there were previous history of treatment with a ototoxic drugs, and most of them developed <dis>severe hearing loss</dis>.
One of them was <dis>deaf-mute</dis>.
No audiometric differences between families with the homoplasmic and the heteroplasmic A1555G mutation were observed.
Conclusions
Patients with the A1555G mutation generally present <dis>bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, ranging from mild to moderate, slowly progressive, which is obvious approximately in the second decade of life and affects specially the high frequencies.
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> severity is increased by treatment with aminoglycosides.Abstract
Spontaneous cervical emphysema and pneumomediastinum, occurring in the absence of previous disorders or provocating factors, is very rare.
The predominant symptoms are retroesternal pain, dyspnea, <dis>dysphagia</dis> and neck pain.
The diagnosis is established radiologically.
The evolution is generally good and conservative therapy leads to recovery in most patients.
We present an unusual case of pneumomediastinum, cervical and retropharyngeal emphysema that spread to cavum; the suspected symptom was voice alteration as reported by the parents.Abstract
 We report the case of a 29 year-old male with of hereditary spherocytosis, who developed two episodes of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> in his right ear after splenectomy due to repetitive hemolytic crisis.
We discuss the eventual altiopathogenic mechanism of this <dis>audiological disorder</dis>.Abstract
Otitis media with effusion is a common disorder in children, associated to <dis>hearing loss</dis> and recurrent acute otitis media.
It has three basic treatments: Spontaneous resolution, oral antibiotics and sur-gery including adenoidectomy and/or grommets insertion.
Through a sensibility analysis on a theo-retical group of 1000 patients our aim is to study the cost-effectiveness of the diff e r e n t therapeutic options, evaluating direct and indirect costs, and identifying the most efficient option (cost-effective).
We analysed effectiveness and variable costs of each arm of the decision tree, considering ini-tial and rescue treatments.
As expected, effectiveness grows up to the most through treatment, in-cluding adenoidectomy and grommets insertion, from 92% to 98% of children treated.
Nevertheless, unitary cost of each child treated also increases, from 302 to 401 euros; that is, choosing the most cost-effective treatment enables to save approximately 100 euros per child.
But, fixed costs, which are much higher (600 euros per child), will not change, limiting our management resources.Abstract
 Introduction
We present a statistic study comparing all the options we can take to face <dis>congenital deafness</dis> as a problem of public health.
Patients and Methods
We collected and analyzed data obtained between 1991 and 1995, just before our universal screening program started.
They were separated into two groups with the 144 children explored using ABR, and the results were compared depending on the option taken in each group (no screening or high risk screening) and finally with those obtained in a universal program.
Results
The establishment of a high risk screening program was followed by a drastic reduction of the <dis>severe deafness</dis> diagnosis (29’5% to 8%), and also of the mean age of diagnosis (24 to 14 months), which were found statistically significant.
The mean age with universal screening is 3 months.
Discussion and conclusions
Early detection of <dis>congenital hearing impairment</dis> has brought an important advance in the management of this problem of public health minimizing its sequels as the diagnosis is reached earlier.
The universal screening of <dis>deafness</dis> is feasible as based on cheap and easy diagnostic techniques available in any centre, and it must be performed with the rest of Health Children Programs.Abstract
 Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) of 50 newborn with negative transient evoked acoustic emissions (OEAT) was performed.
54% of them had no family history of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> (<dis>SHNL</dis>) and no risk factors were found.
In 70% of cases ABR recording was negative.
Follow up did show that 60% of them had normal recordings of hearing and in a 40% different stages of <dis>hearing loss</dis> were seen.
To establish a definitive diagnosis a 1 to 9 month period is necessary.Abstract
 Objective
To know the etiology of <dis>preiperlingual bilateral hearing loss</dis> in children.
Materials and methods
All the patients diagnosed with <dis>bilateral severe/profound, pre or perilingual hearing loss</dis> at Sierrallana and Marqués de Valdecilla Hospitals (Cantabria, Spain) during the last 20 years were included in this study.
Results
A hundred patients were diagnosed with <dis>bilateral severe/profound pre/perilingual hearing loss</dis>.
The most frequent etiology was hereditary (49%), followed by severe perinatal hypoxia (11%), ototoxicity (5%), meningitis (3%), hyperbilirubinemia (3%) and rubella (2%).
In 21% of cases was not Known.
Conclusions
The two most frequent etiologies found in <dis>severe/profound hearing loss</dis> in children in our area were hereditary and non infectious perinatal problems.
Infectious disease were scarce.
Will decrease when genetic test were used as clinical basis.Abstract
 Objectives
To analize the results of patients with cohlear implants in postlingual adults with <dis>progressive hearing loss</dis> and to analize various predictive factors.
Material and methods
Prospective study of 42 patients with <dis>profound and progressive hearing loss</dis>.
We analized the outcomes in the first two years of follow-up.
We examined the results in regards to the of age at time of implantation, other handicaps, cause of <dis>hearing loss</dis>, age of onset, cochlear ossification and actives electrodes.
We use the logo-auditory protocol developed at the University Spanish of navarra.
Results
All tests presented a significative improvement in the first six months (p<0.01 Student t or Wilcoxon test).
After six months the results were not statistically significant.
The more important predictive factors were percentage of life with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, percentage of life with <dis>profound hearing loss</dis>, cochlear ossification and actives electrodes thus the significancy was more relevant at a follow-up period of 3 months (p<0.05 Student t or Mann- Withney test).
Conclusions
These patients showed clear benefits in a short period of time and the patients with unfavourable circumstances had a more slow progression but a similar final outcomeAbstract
 <dis>Sudden deafness</dis> goes on being a clinical entity of unknown cause for which several theories and treatments have been proposed.
We are reporting a comparative study of two different protocols that we have performed on 60 patients (divided in two groups of 30) diagnosed and admitted with <dis>sudden hearing loss</dis> between 1989 and 2003.
The main goal is to prove if there is a statistical and significant difference among both, in respect of the audiologic improvement obtained, after two weeks of therapy at east.
We have applied the normal approximation of Mann-Whitney´s test and we can argue, after its result, our current protocol (piracetam, pentoxifiline, metilprednisolone), which includes 4 days of endovenous treatment another 10 days at home.
The presence of vestibular symptoms darkens the prognosis since about 95% of the patients with them have not improved significantly (p<0.05)Abstract
 We present an 8 years patient old with a giant dilatation of the vestibular aqueduct associated with <dis>profound and progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
The patient received a cochlear implant and during the surgery a pulsatile clear fluid via the cochleostomy was observed, without gusher.
We present all the problems, and offer some advices for this kind of surgery.Abstract
 This is a case report of a papillary thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the parapharyngeal space, that presented with local obstructive symptoms (<dis>dysphagia</dis> and displacement of the ipsilateral tonsil).
The diagnosis was suspected by imaging studies (CT and MRI) but not confirmed until histological examination.
It is not common for such tumors to metastasize to the parapharyngeal space.
This is the reason why, to our knowledge, there have been described only five similar cases previously.Abstract
Several articles show the audiologic benefits of cochlear implants, although it is still necessary to prove their impact on quality of life.
In this study, 36 Med-El processor users were included.
The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) was used to measure changes in quality of life, and another questionnaire was used to evaluate the communication abilities.
Eighty-six percent of the patients answered our questionnaire.
The quality of life improved significantly according to the specific questionnaire.
The average total benefit obtained with the GBI was +41, and the average scores related to general, social and physics benefits were +57, +16, and +3, respectively.
No significant difference was found between quality of life and other parameters like insertion depth of the array, etiology or duration of the <dis>deafness</dis>.Abstract
 Exostoses of the external auditory canal are benign bony tumours very common in individuals who frequently participate in aquatic activities.
Although most of the cases are asymptomatic, patients with more severe exostoses have recurrent episodes of external otitis and related <dis>conductive hearing loss</dis>.
In the great majority of these cases, a medical treatment (aspiration and antibiotic drops) resolves the symptoms.
Patients with more severe canal stenosis, resistant to medical treatment, are candidates for surgical removal of the exostoses.
This report reviews our surgical experience with 45 patients, 52 ears, who have undergone surgical removal of exostoses in our Institution during the last 13 years.
We describe the technique that we use a well as the results that we achieve.Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Cerebral palsy</dis> (<dis>CP</dis>) is the most common <dis>chronic motor disorder</dis> in children and frequently associates sensorial pathology.
The objective of our study was to establish the prevalence and characteristics of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> in children with <dis>CP</dis>.
Methods
We performed a retrospective study of patients born between the years 1975 and 2004, diagnosed of <dis>CP</dis> in the “Marqués de Valdecilla” University Hospital.
Clinical data were collected including the presence of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, age at diagnosis, treatment and associated pathology.
Results
Sixty four patients had confirmed <dis>CP</dis>.
Audiological testing had been performed in thirty patients (47%) of them 18 (60%) had <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> (12 bilateral and 6 unilateral).
In thirteen cases <dis>hearing loss</dis> was associated with <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
The age at diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 7 years (mean 23.2 months).
Eight patients were treated with hearing aids and one with a cochlear implant.
Conclusion
<dis>Sensorineural hearing loss</dis> is frequent in <dis>CP</dis> patients.
Management of this problem is difficult in this setting because of the <dis>motor disorder</dis> and the associated pathology.
Early audiological assessment is very important to improve the language outcome in these children.Abstract
 Introduction
In this study we have analyzed (i) the audiometric frequencies more often affected in acoustic neuroma (AN), (ii) the percentage of patients presenting normal hearing and those with <dis>sudden hearing loss</dis>, (iii) if there is a correlation between tumor size and <dis>hearing loss</dis>, and (iv) the relationship between clinical and radiological parameters and audiological data.
Methods and Material
Retrospective study of 81 patients undergoing surgical removal of a sporadic AN.
Results
The highest threshold in the tumor´s ear was found at 8000 Hz, and the highest interaural difference at 4000 Hz.
The percentage of patients presenting normal hearing and <dis>sudden hearing loss</dis> was 2.5% and 9%, respectively.
No significant association was found between tumor size and <dis>hearing loss</dis>, preoperative facial palsy or Vth cranial nerve deficit.
There was a significant association between the degree of <dis>hearing loss</dis> and Vth cranial nerve deficit, and between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and preoperative facial palsy.
Conclusions
The association between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and Vth cranial nerve deficit, and between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and preoperative facial palsy is independent the size of the tumour.Objective
The aim of the study was to determine the causes of failure in otosclerosis surgery.
Material and method
We performed 23 revisions of stapedectomy during the period between January 2000 and April 2005.
The time between the primary surgery and the revision surgery ranged from 3 months to 25 years.
The most frequent reasons for revision surgery were first of all patients with closed initial gap and <dis>progressive hearing loss</dis> in 56.52 % of cases and secondly patients without any initial hearing improvement in 39.12 % of cases.
Results
The main surgical findings were: short prosthesis in correct position (13.04 %), displaced prosthesis (60.87 %), bridles over the oval window (65.22 %), necrosis of the long process of the incus (26.2 %), and obliterative footplate (26.09 %).
As for the audiometric results, we got a complete closure of gap in 60.8 % of patients (n=14), partial closure of gap in 13.2 % (n=3), persistence of the initial gap in 21.7% (n=5), and <dis>cophosis</dis> in 4.3 % (n=1).
Conclusions
The migration of the prosthesis is the main cause of failure after stapedectomy.
Good closure of the gap was achieved in two thirds of the patients.Introduction
Numerous tests have been developed to help in the diagnosis of the immunomediated inner ear disease (IMIED), although their usefulness is still the subject of some dispute.
Material and method
Studies of cohorts of patients with suspected IMIED have been reviewed.
A number of different serological tests were carried out and their response to immunosuppressive therapy was noted.
Results
After reviewing 790 articles, the studies analyzed present great heterogeneity in the clinical characteristics of the patients recruited (<dis>sudden deafness</dis>, <dis>fluctuating and rapidly progressive hearing loss</dis>, Menière's disease), the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the delay between the diagnosis and the start of medical treatment or the response criteria.
Conclusions
The diagnosis of IMIED is based on clinical presentation and response to corticosteroids.
At present no test represents the gold standard in the diagnosis of IMIED.
Serologic tests can support the diagnosis, but a methodologically more rigorous approach is needed to identify the true clinical importance of these tests for daily practice.Objective
The objective of this paper is to make a retrospective analysis in patients with glomus tumours of temporal bone origin.
We present the results according to the surgical approach applied in each case.
Patients and method
This retrospective study presents the findings in 17 patients with diagnosis of glomus jugulare of the temporal bone, who were observed and treated in our department over a 5-year period (1999 to 2004).
We performed a general otolaryngology exam, systemic evaluation and radiological exam.
Surgical treatment was performed in 16 cases out of 17.
In 1 case treatment with stereotaxic surgery was performed.
Results
The surgical approaches were: retroauricular transcanal approach, radical or modified mastoidectomy through facial recess, and infratemporal fossa approach.
Pre-operative embolization was used in 11 of our cases.
In all cases the diagnosis of glomus tumour was confirmed.
The most frequent post-operative complications found were: transitory paralysis of the facial nerve, <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, imbalance, paralysis of the IXth and XIth cranial nerves, and salivary fistula.
No recurrences were found after 8 years of follow-up.
One case of persistence was found in the case treated with radiosurgery.
Conclusions
In our series surgery was found as the elective therapy for patients with glomus tumour of the temporal bone with no recurrences after 8 years of follow-up.
Pre-operative embolization diminishes surgery time and intraoperative bleeding.
Stereotaxic therapy cannot provide tumour growth control.
Complications are discussed and compared with the bibliography.<dis>Sensorineural hearing loss</dis> has a high incidence in our population; as a matter of fact, 50 % of people above 75 years of age suffer this impairment.
Due to the advances in the devices to alleviate this condition and their verified efficacy, it is now appropriate to review the indications for these devices and provide a detailed description of the audioprosthetic systems used.
These systems can be classified as external non-implantable devices (hearing aids) and implantable prostheses.
The latter can be sub-divided into active implants in the external ear or middle ear, cochlear implants, and auditory brainstem implants (ABI).
Indications for each group are determined by the type and location of the underlying condition as well as by the anatomic, functional, and social characteristics of each patient.
It must be stressed that the selection and monitoring of the treatment is up to the specialist.
Generally speaking, an attempt is made to facilitate the integration of the <dis>hypoacusic</dis> patients to their sound setting by enhancing their understanding of the spoken word and restoring binaurality, while at the same time, seeking to retain the plasticity of central auditory routes through the stimulation provided by any of these systems.
In the course of this review, we refer to newly-emerging indications in both the field of cochlear implants (bimodal stimulation, implantation in patients with residual hearing, bilateral implants, etc) and in the area of ABI in patients with tumoural disease previously treated with radiosurgery or patients with non-tumour pathologies presenting malformations or bilateral cochlear ossification.Introduction
Hyperbilirubinaemia is a neonatal risk factor that has been proved to be associated with <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
A high concentration of unconjugated bilirubin place newborn children at risk of suffering toxic effects, including <dis>hypoacusia</dis>.
Objectives
Review of the newborn screening results with a diagnosis of pathological hyperbilirubinaemia as part of a <dis>hearing-loss</dis> early detection protocol in the general population based on otoemissions and evoked potentials.
Material and method
Retrospective study of 21 590 newborn children screened between 2002 and 2006.
The selection criteria for defining pathological hyperbilirubinaemia were bilirubin concentrations in excess of 14 mg/dL in pre-term infants and 20 mg/dL in full-term babies.
The Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening Programme is a two-phase protocol in which all children are initially subjected to a transient otoacoustic emissions test (TOAE).
Children presenting risk factors associated with auditory neuropathy were always given brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP).
Results
The patients identified as having severe hyperbilirubinaemia in the neonatal period numbered 109 (0.5%) and 96 of these (88.07 %) passed the otoacoustic emissions test at the first attempt and 13 (11.93 %) did not; 11 of the 13 children in whom the otoacoustic emissions test was repeated passed it successfully.
The 2 children who failed to pass the otoacoustic emissions test has normal BAEP results; 3 (2.75 %) of the newborn infants who passed the TOAE test did not pass the BAEP.
Discussion
Hyperbilirubinaemia values previously considered safe may harm the hearing system and give rise to isolated problems in auditory processing without being associated with other signs of classical kernicterus.
Our results show that hyperbilirubinaemia-related auditory neuropathy reveals changes over time in the audiometric outcomes.An ischaemic infarction of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) is usually associated with vertigo, <dis>hearing loss</dis>, <dis>facial palsy</dis>, nystagmus, or <dis>truncal ataxia</dis>; it is often accompanied by other brainstem or cerebellar signs.
<dis>Suddenonset bilateral hearing loss</dis> without associated neurological symptoms is infrequent in the literature.
We report a case of <dis>sudden bilateral hearing loss</dis>, later diagnosed as AICA infarction without other symptoms.Abstract
 Introduction
Numerous experimental and clinical studies have suggested a critical or sensitive period in which the auditory pathway develops its greatest potential in terms of plasticity and learning.
Early cochlear implantation performed in <dis>prelingual deaf</dis> children in this period provides a better prognosis for language acquisition.
The aim of this study is to show the importance of cochlear implantation before this critical period ends.
Methods
We conducted an observational, longitudinal, retrospective study of 57 children suffering <dis>profound prelingual bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis> who had received Advanced Bionics implants at our ENT department between June, 1998, and November, 2006.
Data on their audiometric thresholds, the disyllabic word test adapted to children, open-set sentences recognition test and the Nottingham scale were analyzed.
Results
The analysis of audiometric thresholds showed no differences between children receiving the implants at different ages.
However, statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were found in speech tests between groups of children receiving the implants before and after 4 years of age.
Conclusions
Our results are in line with other publications showing differences in auditory performance when comparing children with early implants versus children receiving the implants at a later age.
We found the greatest differences at 4 years of age.
Nevertheless, these findings should not exclude children over this age from implantation.Abstract
 Introduction
Intratympanic drug delivery for labyrinth diseases is a non-aggressive outpatient procedure where drugs reach high concentrations in the cochlea and minimum systemic diffusion.
The aim of this review is to update the delivery techniques and report on the results obtained with different substances in cochleovestibular disorders.
New perspectives in drug development and gene therapy are discussed.
Material and method
We have analyzed the literature published to date using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.
The categories chosen for the review where the delivery techniques, the results using corticosteroids and aminoglucosides (gentamicin) and isolated papers related with new drugs or pathways to introduce the substance in the inner ear.
Results
Intratympanic steroid therapy has been shown to be effective for cochleovestibular symptoms after failure of systemic steroids for <dis>sudden deafness</dis> and for control of Ménière's disease.
Intratympanic gentamicin using a titration method showed vertigo control in 80% of the patients with a 0–25% risk of <dis>hearing impairment</dis> in Ménière's disease.
Conclusions
Intratympanic delivery is an effective procedure for the control of cochleovestibular disorders such as <dis>sudden deafness</dis> and Ménière's disease.
Future perspectives could increase the indications for steroid and gentamicin treatment and open the door to new drugs and gene therapy.Abstract
 We report the case of a 67-year-old male diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma, who referred <dis>dysphagia</dis>, dysphonia and noticed the appearance of a laterocervical mass.
A CT scan revealed an osteolytic soft tissue neck lesion, which was resected.
Its anatomical-pathological study was compatible with metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma.Abstract
 The aim of the study is to present the severe, extensive lesions in the temporal bone appearing in the mildest forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, correlate these with audiometric results and discuss the possible surgical treatments available.
We present three patients suffering <dis>hearing loss</dis> due to osteogenesis imperfecta type 1 to various functional degrees.
All patients underwent an audiological, medical and radiological evaluation and were then treated with different surgical procedures.
The patients presented <dis>mild, severe and profound mixed hearing losses</dis> and the radiological images showed extensive areas of demineralization affecting the ossicular chain and removal of protection for the vital structures inside the temporal bone.
Also, the cochlea showed otic capsule demineralization, dehiscence, distortions and even destructions.
The various surgical treatments, indicated under current international criteria, obtained limited functional results.
This study reviews the need to evaluate the current surgical criteria for this specific condition.Abstract
 Introduction
Endoscopic sinus surgery presents a series of complications that can vary depending on the technique used and the surgeon's experience.
This technique needs a learning curve, which must be developed during the residence training program.
Methods
Descriptive and retrospective study, reviewing the medical records of endoscopic sinus surgery for nasal polyps of 192 patients who had undergone operations performed by residents at our department between January 2002 and January 2008.
Patient sex, age, affectation scale and minor and major complications were described.
All these procedures were performed by 3rd or 4th-year residents under the supervision of a faculty member.
Results
Of the 192 patients, 127 (66.14%) were male and 65 (33.85%) female, aged between 24 and 78 years old, with a mean age of 49 years old.
Nasal endoscopy revealed polyposis of grade i, 19 (9.8%) cases; grade ii, 55 (28.6%); and grade iii, 118 (61.45%).
There were 44 (22.9%) total complications, 40 (20.8%) minor and 4 (2.08%) major complications.
The most common minor complication was synechia formation in 21(10.93%) cases, followed by bleeding without need for transfusion in 12 (6.25%).
The major complication was a breach of the lamina papyracea in 4 patients (2.08%).
There were no cases of <dis>blindness</dis>, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, or death.
Conclusions
Endoscopic sinus surgery in an otolaryngology residency training program is a relatively safe procedure, especially when performed under faculty supervision.Abstract
 Introduction
Ménière's disease is characterised by vertigo, <dis>hearing loss</dis> and tinnitus.
Various studies assess the problem of vertigo and audition deficit in Ménière's disease, but only a few of these relate to the clinical characteristics of tinnitus, the aim of this study.
Material and methods
A transversal descriptive study of the behaviour of tinnitus in 88 patients in different stages of Ménière's disease treated in a tertiary hospital was carried out.
The different characteristics of disease were analysed: intensity was evaluated with an analogue-visual scale, subjective tonality through tonal shade references, the impact on the patient's quality of life was tested by a self-appraisal questionnaire, and competence level was evaluated with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory.
Epidemiologic factors, personal records, hearing thresholds and evolution in the number of vertiginous crises in the previous six months were also taken into account.
Results
The average time of evolution of the disease was 15.4 years.
The results evidence the development of tinnitus of moderate intensity (5/10) and low frequency (46%), with a slight impact on quality of life.
Worsening in the quality of life related to hearing affectation and/or advanced stages of the disease was also observed.
We identified high frequency tonality, a medical record of depression and youth as unfavourable prognostic factors.
There was no relationship found with the years of evolution of the disease or with the number of vertigo crises.
Conclusion
In large samples of long evolution Ménière's disease, patients do not perceive tinnitus as a problem that produces serious impairment in their quality of life.Abstract
 Introduction
The A1555G mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation is responsible for <dis>maternally inherited non-syndromic hearing loss</dis> that is increased by aminoglycoside exposure.
The objective of this study was to ascertain the frequency of the A1555G mutation among patients without family history of <dis>hearing loss</dis> or known exposition to aminoglycosides.
Methods
We screened for the mtDNA A1555G mutation in Spanish patients with <dis>sporadic sensorineural hearing impairment</dis> without a known family history of <dis>hearing loss</dis> or aminoglycoside exposition seen at the ENT Department in Sierrallana Hospital (Torrelavega, Cantabria, Spain) over a four-year period.
Results
A total of 219 patients with <dis>bilateral hearing loss</dis> were screened.
Two of them (0.9%) had the A1555G mitochondrial DNA mutation.
Both patients had a <dis>moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss for low frequency</dis>, and moderate to severe loss for high-frequency.
Conclusions
The mtDNA A1555G mutation in patients with <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> without family history of <dis>deafness</dis> or aminoglycoside ototoxicity is infrequent in our region.
We should suspect this mutation in patients younger than 50 years old, with <dis>postlingual bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis> that is more pronounced at high frequency.Abstract
 Introduction and objective
Several authors have found increased anxiety in patients the day before an intervention and its correlation with anxiety levels the post-operative period.
In this study, we determined a number of problems to which patients who underwent total laryngectomy often objected: the tracheostomy, being left without a voice and it being an aggressive, major surgery.
Our objective was to assess the degree of anxiety and fears of the patient prior to total laryngectomy.
Material and methods
We compared 2 groups of 20 patients who underwent operation for total laryngectomy and for other ENT pathologies.
On the day before the operation, we collected demographic and medical data and administered the Spanish versions of the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28).
We also investigated whether the patients had any fear or fear of surgery and what that fear was.
Results
Completion of the MMSE revealed <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in only one patient.
We subsequently conducted the GHQ-28 and found psychological distress in 20-25% of our cases.
When the different fears in both groups were compared by X2, the results were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Total laryngectomy causes the <dis>loss of oral communication</dis> and impairs self- image, contributing to a strong emotional reaction.
It is essential to have effective rehabilitation, which considers all aspects of health-sickness, such as the recovery of spoken language, social aspects and the psychological characteristics, vital for proper comprehensive patient management.Abstract
 Turner syndrome (TS) is the human being's most frequent sex chromosome abnormality.
<dis>Progressive sensorineural hearing loss</dis> is documented in more than 50% of the women affected by this syndrome.
Although Mondini defect is the cochlear congenital malformation most frequently identified in other polymalformative syndromes, it has rarely been reported in TS.
We describe the case of a 32-year-old woman with TS who presented <dis>progressive sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
The computed tomography of the ears showed bilateral Mondini deformity.Abstract
 Introduction and objectives
Genomic medicine investigates groups of genetic markers that determine susceptibility for complex diseases.
The aim of this review was to introduce genomics to the clinical otorhinolaryngologist.
Technological advances in genotyping and sequencing that have facilitated genome-wide association studies in common causes of <dis>hearing loss</dis> during the last years are summarised.
Methods
A search strategy in _PubMed_ was designed using the following keywords: (gene OR genomics OR GWAS OR high throughput) AND (hearing loss OR chronic otitis media OR age-related hearing loss OR otosclerosis OR Meniere's disease) during the last 5 years.
A total of 1,846 references were obtained.
After filtering by human studies and English as the language of publication, 1,295 summaries were evaluated, selecting 58 papers.
Results
The impact of sequencing the human genome in the knowledge of genome architecture, DNA variability and the significance of structural variations in the sequence to cause diseases is presented.
The evolution of sequencing technology has determined the design and performance of genetic association studies.
Finally, we present genetic association studies performed in common causes of ear diseases.Abstract
 Introduction and goals
Idiopathic sudden <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> is a <dis>hearing disorder</dis> of unknown cause.
The spontaneous recovery rate ranges from 50 to 75% of the patients.
Scientific experiments on animals support the present study in patients with <dis>sudden deafness</dis> treated with sounds.
Patients and methods
During the period 2003-2009, patients with idiopathic sudden <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> were administered steroids, piracetam and antioxidants, together with the addition of sounds by means of music and words.
Results
Comparing the results of patients treated with medication (n = 65) and those treated with medication and sounds (n = 67), it was observed that patients treated with medication and sounds had higher recovery.
Within the group of patients treated with medication and sounds, 25 (37%) experienced complete recovery, 28 (42%) good recovery, 11 (16%) slight recovery and 3 (5%) poor or no recovery.
Conclusion
The patients who recovered more than half of their audition accounted for 54% in the group treated with medication and for 79% in the group of patients receiving medication and sounds.
Auditory recuperation showed no alterations, at least up to 12 months after therapy.Abstract
 Introduction
Otosclerosis is an osteodystrophy of the labyrinthine capsule producing <dis>conductive hearing loss</dis>.
If the process invades the cochlea, a <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> usually takes place.
The cochlear implant is a good alternative in these patients.
Objective
To ascertain the behaviour of cochlear implantation in otosclerosis.
Material and methods
We reviewed a database of 250 patients that underwent cochlear implantation, performing a retrospective study of 13 patients with clinical, audiological and/or imaging findings of bilateral otosclerosis.
The 26 ears were studied as to their natural history, previous surgeries, evolution to <dis>profound hearing loss</dis>, computed tomography images, complications and functional results.
Results
Of the cases studied, 46% were female and 54% were men, with a mean age of 26 years at the onset of <dis>conductive hearing loss</dis>.
Stapes surgery was performed in 19 ears (73%), with a mean patient age of 29 years, and 53% of them underwent cochlear implantation.
Computed tomography results showed that there were signs of different degrees of radiological affectation in 54% of the ears.
A total of 3 complications took place (23%): implant failure, overstimulation of the facial nerve and bilateral tinnitus were found.
One year after implantation, the average percentages of correct 2-syllable words were 80% and 85% in open sentences.
Conclusions
Patients having <dis>profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis> secondary to otosclerosis obtain great benefit from cochlear implantation.Abstract
 Introduction
Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea results from an abnormal communication between the subarachnoid space and tympanomastoid compartment; most of them are of traumatic aetiology.
They have clinical interest due to the potential risk of meningitis, directly related to the aetiology.
Our aim was to show our experience in the management of this process.
Methods
A total of 17 patients diagnosed and treated for cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea from 2003 to 2011.
Results
In our study, the highest percentage of cases was spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea, with a wide clinical presentation.
The diagnosis was based on the determination of beta-2-transferrin and radiological studies, especially important for its locator value.
The treatment of choice was surgery.
Conclusions
Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea is a rare entity in otorhinolaryngological pathology.
Its diagnosis is suspected through otorrhea, <dis>hearing loss</dis> and aural fullness, while computed tomography and magnetic resonance help us to locate the defect.
Surgery is the preferred technique, and its success is based on multilayer technology with 2 or more support materials.Abstract
 <dis>Sensorineural hearing loss</dis> is a caused by the loss of the cochlear hair cells with the consequent deafferentation of spiral ganglion neurons.
Humans do not show endogenous cellular regeneration in the inner ear and there is no exogenous therapy that allows the replacement of the damaged hair cells.
Currently, treatment is based on the use of hearing aids and cochlear implants that present different outcomes, some difficulties in auditory discrimination and a limited useful life.
More advanced technology is hindered by the functional capacity of the remaining spiral ganglion neurons.
The latest advances with stem cell therapy and cellular reprogramming have developed several possibilities to induce endogenous regeneration or stem cell transplantation to replace damaged inner ear hair cells and restore hearing function.
With further knowledge of the cellular and molecular biology of the inner ear and its embryonic development, it will be possible to use induced stem cells as _in vitro_ models of disease and as replacement cellular therapy.
Investigation in this area is focused on generating cellular therapy with clinical use for the treatment of <dis>profound sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
The studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of bilateral cochlear implantation in children suggest an improvement in hearing about sound localization and speech discrimination.
In this paper we show the differences in audio-linguistic achievements with early bilateral cochlear implantation versus unilateral, and differences between simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation.
Material and methods
We present 88 children with <dis>bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, treated with bilateral cochlear implantation in 32 cases and unilateral in 56 cases, during the first 12 months (27 children) of life and between 12 and 24 months (61 children).
We conducted a statistical comparison of both groups in the audiometry, IT-Mais, Nottingham, LittlEars scales and verbal tests.
Results
No significant differences in hearing thresholds and questionnaires between unilateral and bilateral implantation were detected in either the first or second year.
Verbal tests do show statistically significant differences: children with bilateral cochlear implant obtain 100% recognition of disyllabic and phrases within 2-3 years after implantation whilst children with one implant do not obtain those results at 5 years after surgery.
No differences between simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation were detected.
Conclusion
We emphasize the importance of ensuring good early audiological screening, to carry out an early and bilateral cochlear implantation with the consequent development of audio-language skills similar to normal hearing children.Introduction
This study aims to analyse the knowledge of cochlear implant (CI) candidacy criteria of otorhinolaryngology specialists in Spain, and from the results, consider whether it is necessary to implement training measures aimed at improving knowledge in this area.
Material and methods
A questionnaire was designed for measuring the level of knowledge of cochlear implant candidacy criteria (CI) in people with <dis>hearing loss</dis>. 
The questionnaire collected the demographic data of the respondents and their knowledge on the conventional and emergency indications for CI, technical characteristics of CI and results in the implanted population.
Results
A total of 222 Spanish specialists in otorhinolaryngology answered the questionnaire (10.29% of the sample surveyed).
Conclusions
The 50% of all respondents showed a medium-high knowledge about CI. 
Epidemiological data suggest that a high percentage of adults with <dis>postlocutive deafness</dis> and candidates for a CI are not referred for treatment. 
The lack of knowledge about the criteria for the indication of CI by otorhinolaryngology specialists may contribute to inadequate guidance of patients who are potential candidates for CI. 
The greatest shortcomings are found in the most emergency indications for a CI. 
Among otorhinolaryngology professionals, the greatest knowledge about CI is found in those who work in tertiary hospitals in the areas of otology and otoneurology, either in the public or private sector. 
This study suggests that training on CI should be increased for otorhinolaryngology professionals, especially for general otorhinolaryngologists.Abstract
—A new case of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome is reported, with particular reference to the presence of typical lesions of _acanthosis nigricans_ in the axillae.
The patient is a 17-year-old male presenting general features of <dis>mild mental retardation</dis>, anomalies in the craniofacial phenotype and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
At the cutaneous level, he presented disseminated follicular hyperkeratosis with cicatricial alopecia in the eyebrows, multiple pigmented nevi, acanthosis _nigricans_ in the axillae and curly hair.Abstract
—Pterygium inversum unguis is an uncommon anomaly of the distal part of the nail bed.
It remains adherent to the ventral surface of the nail plate resulting in the extension of the hyponichium outside the usual limits and producing the obliteration of the distal cleft.
This nail disorder may be congenital or acquired.
The acquired secondary forms are the most common, usually related to conective tissue diseases.
We report a 22 year-old girl with <dis>slight mental retardation</dis> who consulted complaining of a nail deformity on the first fingers of her hands.
This deformity consisted of adherence of the distal part of the nail bed to the ventral surface of the nail plate showing the distal groove obliterated.
It had arisen in the last five years.
Patient denied trauma or use nail polish.
Analysis performed to rule out associated systemic diseases were negative.Abstract
—Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of storage disorders in which the deficiency of a certain lysosomal enzyme causes the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the lysosomes of the cells of several organs, including the skin.
Hunter syndrome, or type-II mucopolysaccharidosis, is due to a deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase, which gives rise to the accumulation of and increase in the urinary excretion of dermatan and heparan sulfates.
The manifestations of Hunter syndrome include multiple dysostoses, organomegaly, coarse facies, absence of corneal clouding and <dis>mental retardation with progressive neurological deterioration in the severe form</dis>.
Non-specific cutaneous changes that can be seen in all mucopolysaccharidoses are thickened skin with a loss of elasticity on elbows and knees, rough hair and hypertrichosis.
The presence of ivory-colored papules over the scapular region and outer lateral sides of the arms and thighs is typical and almost pathognomonic of Hunter syndrome.
We present the case of a boy with the moderate form of Hunter syndrome, who presented with skin lesions typical of this syndrome.Abstract
 We present a male patient with photosensitivity since the earliest months of his life, and pigmented macules in exposed areas, some showing clinical atypia, which increased in number over time.
Molecular biology studies detected an alteration in DNA repair ability, so xeroderma pigmentosum was diagnosed.
Shortly after birth, low weight, microcephaly and <dis>psychomotor retardation</dis> had been observed, but the cause was not established.
The patient progressively showed neurological disorders that included <dis>perceptive deafness</dis>, hyporeflexia and areflexia, as well as choreoathetotic movements.
Therefore, we felt that the patient's symptoms fit De Sanctis- Cacchione syndrome.Abstract
 Proteins belonging to the RAS/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway play key roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death.
For more than 30 years now we have known that 30% of human cancers carry somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins from this pathway.
Whereas somatic mutations have a high malignant potential, germline mutations are linked to <dis>developmental abnormalities</dis> that are often poorly clinically differentiated, although each is dependent upon the specific gene affected.
Thus, all patients share varying degrees of <dis>mental retardation</dis> or <dis>learning difficulties</dis>, heart disease, facial dysmorphism, skin anomalies, and, in some cases, predisposition to cancer.
These syndromes, known as rasopathies, include Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, neurofibromatosis-1, LEOPARD syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome.
Recognizing the skin manifestations of rasopathies can facilitate diagnosis of these syndromes.TRUE ANEURYSMS OF THE SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL ARTERY: A CASE REPORT
Summary
Introduction.
_True aneurysms of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) are rare entities.
Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in PubMed and the largest series consists of 13 patients.
Here we report the case of a patient with bilateral true aneurysms in the SFA and the surgical treatment that was performed to treat them._ 
Case report.
_A 78-yearold male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign hypoplasia of the prostate and <dis>blindness</dis> since infancy due to pigmentary retinitis.
The patient visited the emergency department after having lumps on the inner side of both thighs for several years and claudication of the soleus-gastrocnemius muscle in the left lower limb at 300 m.
Examination revealed the presence of pulsatile masses with systolic murmurs in the mid-third of the thigh in both lower limbs (LL) and a distal to popliteal occlusion in the left lower limb.
Doppler ultrasound recording was performed on the LL and the results showed aneurysmal dilatation measuring 72 × 35 mm in the right SFA and 63 × 28 mm in the left SFA.
The angiography study of the LL confirmed the presence of aneurysms at that level.
Elective surgery was performed involving resection of the aneurysm and end-to- end placement of an 8-mm PTFE graft.
The aneurysms presented a thrombus and arteriosclerotic thickening of their walls.
Anti-aggregating treatment consisting in 150 mg of acetylsalicylic acid was established and the patient was discharged from hospital five days after surgery._ 
Conclusions.
_True aneurysms of the SFA are rare.
They are associated with a high rate of thromboembolic complications and rupture.
Preferred treatment consists in resection and placement of a prosthetic or venous graft.

Background
To report the social and medical situation of centenarian patients who required emergency hospital care during the last 8 years.
Method
Retrospective study of patients aged over 100 years attended at the Emergency Department of a general hospital.
The percentages of admissions and mortality rates were then compared with those among patients aged over 65.
Results
A total of 51 consultations from 41 patients were recorded, with a mean age of 101.2 years.
The number of consultations increased gradually with time (p = 0.008).
Ninety-three percent of patients lived with their families, predominantly in the rural setting.
The most prevalent conditions included the prostatic syndrome (among males), heart failure and chronic obstruction to the airflow.
Only 20% of patients had <dis>dementia</dis>.
Sixty-four percent of consultations required hospital admission, with a mortality rate of 20.5% in this group of patients.
The most common discharge diagnoses were heart failure and acute cerebrovascular accident.
Conclusions
A gradual increase in hospital care is likely to be excepted among centenarians, who have an acceptable health status, although with a high risk of mortality during hospital admission.Basis
.
To describe the evolution and results of the rehabilitation of elderly disabled cared in an average stay geriatric unit, and to define the factors associated with functional improvement and post-discharge institutionalization.
Patients and method
.
Observational longitudinal study in 459 patients with <dis>functional disability</dis> consecutively hospitalized between May 2000 and December 2001.
Basal variables collected included the clinical, functional, mental, and sociodemographic manifestations previous to the admission.
The favorable functional response (defined as a functional gain during the admission of ≥ 20 points in the Barthel index) and the post-discharge institutionalization were regarded the main result variables.
Results
.
The average age of patients was 80.56 (SD:± 7.45) years, 64.9% were women and 81% came from acute hospital units; the main cause of disability was stroke (48.5%) followed by orthopedic pathology (26.2%) and immobility for different causes (23.5%).
72.5% of patients get functional improvement and 16.4% were institutionalized after the discharge.
The main independent risk factors for poor functional response found in the multivariate analysis were a scoring in Pfeiffer's cognitive test of 5-7 points (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0,22-0.78) and ≥ 8 (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.71), and a scoring in Barthel's index < 60 prior to the deterioration (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14-0.93).
Independent risk factors for institutionalization after the discharge were age (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12), and a scoring in the Gijon's sociofamiliar scale ≥ 9 (OR: 6.83; 95% CI: 1.91-24.47).
A <dis>functional disability</dis> after the discharge in the Barthel's index < 40 also was independently associated to post-discharge institutionalization (OR: 3,07; 95% CI: 1.04-10.06).
Conclusions
.
Most of elderly with recent disability benefit functionally from care in specific hospital geriatric units.
<dis>Moderate or severe cognitive deterioration</dis> after hospitalization is associated to lower recovery probability.
Very advanced age, higher social precariousness and severe disability after discharge are associated with higher risk of institutionalization.Purpose
Cross-sectional study to validate a Spanish version of the 5 and 15 items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS 5 and 15) in a non-selected community dwelling older population, compared with the clinical diagnosis of depression (using DSM-IV criteria) as gold standard.
Patients and method
A total of 301 subjects randomly selected from the >64 years old population served by a public Primary Care Center in Madrid were included.
<dis>Severe cognitive impairment</dis> (MMSE < 20/30), <dis>severe hearing impairment</dis> and denial to participate were exclusion criteria.
A descriptive and a screening study were performed.
Results
The prevalence of depression in this population was 14.6%.
The 5- item GDS had a sensitivity of 0.864 (0.762-0.965), specificity of 0.856 (0.813-0.899), PPV 0.507 (0.394-0.62), NPV 0.973 (0.952-0.994), and positive likelihood ratio 6 (4.34-8.26).
The 15-item GDS had a sensitivity of 0.818 (0.704-0.932), specificity of 0.977 (0.958-0.995), PPV 0.857 (0.751-0.963), NPV 0.969 (0.948-0.99), and positive likelihood ratio 35.03 (28.76-40.77).
Conclusions
GDS-5 may be useful screening test for depression in non selected elderly patients in primary care.
It has better sensitivity than GDS-15 and similar area under curve.Objectives
To analyze clinical, functional, mental, sociofamiliar, and evolutional characteristics of pluripathological patients (PP) in Primary Health Care setting.
Patients and method
Prospective, multiinstitutional cohort study in four Primary Health Care Institutions by active identification of PP from a computerized registry using the Spanish Andalusian Health Care Council criteria.
A clinical interview was proposed to all identified patients.
The clinical data, Barthel index (BI), Pfeiffer scale, clinical vulnerability (CV), sociofamiliar features by the Gijon scale, and 1-year admissions and mortality were analyzed.
An univariant and multivariant analysis was performed in order to know the risk factors associated to previously described variables.
Results
Overall, 806 PP were detected (1.38% of the population).
Cardiovascular categories were the most prevalent.
A total of 662 patients (69%) were eligible for the interview.
Median BI was 90 (0-100), and 24% of patients had <dis>severe functional impairment</dis> (BI < 60).
Twenty-nine percent of them had been admitted to hospital at least once in the last 3 months.
Patients with more <dis>functional impairment</dis> and CV were older, having more defining categories, especially E category.
A total of 174 patients (37.75%) had <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
This group was older, with more <dis>functional impairment</dis>, and worse sociofamiliar support.
One-year mortality was 6.1%, and was correlated with CV and older age.
Conclusions
The definition of PP used selects in the Primary Care setting a population with a high level of multidimensional frailty having a high prevalence of <dis>functional, cognitive deterioration</dis>, sociofamiliar problems, CV and consumption of health care resources.
Due to this multidimensional deterioration, it is recommendable to make an integral evaluation in the health care practice of these patients.Abstract
 A 77-year old man who consulted due to left arm weakness and <dis>dysarthria</dis>.
He reported having been diagnosed of high blood pressure and that he was taking enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide without adequate blood pressure control.
He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes a day and continues to smoke at present.
He was admitted to the emergency service about 90 min after the onset of his symptoms.
He did not report headache, nausea or vomiting.
His BP was 182/104 mmHg, with irregular pulse at 88 beats per minute.
The neurological examination revealed <dis>dysarthria</dis>, left homonymous hemianopsia, muscle weakness and hypoesthesia of the left limbs.
How should this patient be evaluated and treated?Abstract
 Lesch-Nyhan disease is a rare genetic disease characterized by a deficiency in the function of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT).
Patients affected by this disease experience hyperuricemia, <dis>motor disorders</dis>, <dis>mental retardation</dis> and, in the most severe cases, self-mutilation.
Its clinical manifestations depend on the enzymatic activity of HGPRT, which is classically linked to the type of alteration in the HGPRT gene.
More than 400 mutations of this gene have been found.
At present, one of the controversial aspects of the disease is the relationship between the genotype and phenotype; cases have been described lacking a mutation, such as the patient presented in this article, as well as families who despite sharing the same genetic defect show disorders with differing severity.
Epigenetic processes, which modify the genetic expression without changing the sequence of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), could explain the clinical variability observed in this disease.Abstract
 Introduction
There is little information on the limitation of therapeutic effort (LTE) in patients admitted to hospital internal medicine units.
Objectives
To describe the indicated LTE regimens in the departments of internal medicine and the characteristics of the patients who undergo them.
Patients and methods
An observational, descriptive retrospective study was conducted on 4 hospitals of the Community of Madrid.
The study collected demographic and comorbidity data and the LTE orders prescribed for all patients who died during a period of 6 months.
Results
The study included 382 patients with a mean age of 85 ± 10 years; 204 were women (53.4%) and 222 (58.1%) came from their homes.
Some 51.1% of the patients were terminal, 43.2% had <dis>moderate to severe dementia</dis>, and 95.5% presented at least moderate comorbidity.
Some type of LTE was performed in 318 patients (83.7%); the most common orders were “No cardiopulmonary resuscitation” (292 patients, 76.4%; 95% CI 72.1-80.8), “Do not use aggressive measures” (113 patients, 16.4%; 95% CI 13.7-19.4) and “Do not transfer to an intensive care unit” (102 cases, 14.8%, 95% CI 12.3-17.7).
Some type of LTE was performed in 318 patients (83.7%); the most common orders were “No cardiopulmonary resuscitation” (292 patients, 76.4%; 95% CI 72.1-80.8), “Do not use aggressive measures” (113 patients, 16.4%; 95% CI 13.7-19.4) and “Do not transfer to an intensive care unit” (102 cases, 14.8%, 95% CI 12.3-17.7).
Conclusions
LTE is common among patients who die in Internal Medicine.
The most widely used regimens were “No CPR” and the unspecific statement “Do not use aggressive measures”.
The patients were elderly and had significant comorbidity, terminal illness and <dis>advanced dementia</dis>.Background
Our aims were to develop a Spanish version of the short portable mental status questionnaire (SPMSQ) (Pfeiffer’s test) and to validate the resultant Spanish version of the test among a general population aged 65 years or older.
Patients, Material And Methods
First, we developed the Spanish version of the SPMSQ by means of a cross- cultural adaptation methodology.
Patients were the assessed by independent teams in two sessions the same day.
The first team (two trained psychiatrists and one trained family physician) carried out a standardised neuropsychological assessment to diagnose <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>/<dis>dementia</dis> according to ICD-10 criteria wich was regarded as the reference “gold standard” to calculate validity parameters (sensitivity and specificity).
The second team (family physicians/nurses) assessed the presence of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> with the Spanish version of the SPMSQ.
Results
255 subjects (66.7%, females) underwent the assessment.
Mean age was 74.5 years and 65.5% of them were illiterate.
The inter-rater reliability and test- retest reliability of the SPMSQ Spanish version were 0.738 (p < 0.001), and 0.925 (p < 0.001), respectively, with a convergent validity of 0.74 (p < 0.001) and a discriminant validity of 0.230 (p < 0.001).
The internal consistency was high with an αvalue of 0.82.
The area under the ROC curve was 0.89.
Sensitivity and specificity were 85.7 and 79.3, respectively (cut-off of 3 or more).
Conclusions
The Spanish version of the SPMSQ test has a good reliability and validity.
For clinical use, a cut-off of 3 appears to be most useful.
When illiterate patients are assessed, the it is recommended to employ a cut-off of 4 or more.It is well-known that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment for some <dis>mental disorders</dis> in adults.
Hovewer, its use in children and adolescents is still the cause of some fears which may not be justified.
The aim of this article is to clarify and to present the state of this question by reviewing the literature about ECT in children and adolescents, with emphasis on efficacy, indications, adverse effects and limitations.
Results from studies in this population group show similar safety and efficacy data as those observed in adults.
There exists a misinformation about the ECT tecnique among child psychologists and psychiatritsts.
Large follow-up studies are needed.Antiphospholipid syndrome can be associated with several neurological manifestations.
The most common symptom is headache.
It has also been associated with <dis>cognitive dysfunction</dis>, probably due to ischemia.
A high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies has been found in patients with epilepsy and in transverse myelitis.
The most common thrombotic manifestation is stroke.
Venous thrombosis can also be found, yet it is less frequent.
A stroke in a young person obliges to rule out the antiphospholipid syndrome.
The neurological manifestations can mimic multiple sclerosis.
Thus, determination of antiphospholipid antibodies is recommended in the study of patients with atypical manifestations of multiple sclerosis.
Other manifestations associated with antiphospholipid antibodies include chorea, <dis>neurosensorial deafness</dis>, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and psychotic disorders.Background and objective
The ESEMeD-Spain project is an epidemiological study about <dis>mental disorders</dis> in Spain.
We present 12 month-prevalence and lifetime-prevalence of the main mood, anxiety and alcohol use disorders; the influence of sociodemographic factors on its presence and age of onset of the disorders.
Subjects and method
Cross-sectional household survey of a representative sample of the population of Spain 18 years or older.
Sample size was 5.473 individuals.
The WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMHCIDI) was used.
Response rate was 78.6%.
Results have been weighted to represent the population of Spain.
Results
19.5% of the individuals presented a <dis>mental disorder</dis> sometime in their lifetime (lifetime- prevalence) and 8.4% in the last 12 months (12 month- prevalence).
The most frequent <dis>mental disorder</dis> was major depressive episode, with a 12-month prevalence of 3.9% and a lifetime- prevalence of 10.5%.
The other most lifetime prevalent disorders were specific phobia, alcohol abuse disorder, and disthymia.
Factors associated to presenting a <dis>mental disorder</dis> were being female, being separated, divorced or widowed, and being unemployed, on sick leave or incapacitated.
Social phobia, agoraphobia and specific phobia appear at younger ages, while mood disorders and panic disorder appears later in life.
Conclusions
The ESEMeD-Spain study can provide careful outcomes to understand the impact of <dis>mental disorders</dis> in Spain.Background and objective
Chronic back pain (CBP) and chronic neck pain (CNP) are highly prevalent among the adult population.
However, less is known about its comorbidity with other diseases and its impact on global functioning.
The objectives of following study, that is part of the ESEMeD-Spain study, are to estimate CBP-CNP prevalence among Spanish population, its comorbidity with other physical and mental conditions, and its impact on global functioning.
Subjects and method
Cross-sectional household survey of a representative sample of the population of Spain 18 years or older.
Sample size was 5,473 individuals.
CBP-CNP and comorbid conditions were ascertained by self-report.
<dis>Mental disorders</dis> were ascertained with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and global functioning with the WHO Dissability Assessment Schedule.
Response rate was 78.6%.
Results
The one year prevalence of chronic CBP-CNP was 14.7%.
A 65.7% of people with CBP-CNP reported at least one other comorbid condition, including other chronic pain conditions (49.4%), chronic physical conditions (40.7%), any mood disorders (7.9%), panic disorder (1.3%), posttraumatic stress disorder (1.5%) or generalized anxiety disorder (1.4%).
Additionally, CBP-CNP negatively affected global functioning.
However, comorbid conditions explained about one- third of the association between CBP-CNP and global functioning.
Conclusions
CBP-CNP is highly prevalent and comorbid with other physical and mental conditions.
Comorbidity negatively affects individuals global functioning.Background and objective
The Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome is a progressive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia characterized by a short trunk dwarfism, barrel chest, sternal protrusion, kyphoscoliosis, severe platyspondyly, with a central constriction, irregular iliac wings with a lacy appearance, rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, microcephaly, coarse face, and <dis>variable mental retardation</dis>.
This condition is extremely rare and the diagnosis is difficult without any previous experience on it.
It is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition, its gene (DYM) having been mapped in the 18q12-21.1 chromosomal region.
At least 21 different mutations of this gene have been reported.
Material and methods
We describe an affected Spanish child and include his molecular analysis.
We also review the current knowledge on this syndrome.
Results
The diagnosis of this patient, based on his clinical and radiological features, was later confirmed by analysis of the DYM gene mutations.
The patient had two different mutations, one inherited from the mother and the other inherited from the father.
Conclusions
One of the mutations of this patient (exon 8) is extremely rare and has mostly been reported in patients with Spanish ancestors (from Chile, Argentina, Guam islands and a French patient with Spanish ancestors).
These observations, together with that of the patient described here, led us to consider this mutation as having a possible Spanish/Portuguese origin.
This condition may be more frequent in Spain than previously thought, especially due to misdiagnosis.
This is important in order to undertake quaternary prevention, which is quite necessary for rare syndromes with polysystemic affectation.Background and objective
<dis>Alternating hemiplegia of childhood</dis> (<dis>AHC</dis>) is a rare disease of unknown etiology characterized by early onset of recurrent episodes of <dis>hemiplegia</dis>, tonic or dystonic attacks and abnormal ocular movements with a fatal outcome to severe encephalopathy.
Our aim was to describe the clinical manifestations, precipitating factors, complementary studies results, long-term outcome and response to treatment in a series of <dis>AHC</dis> patients.
Patients and method
Descriptive, retrospective and multicenter study in 17 Spanish patients aged between 1-24 years who fulfilled diagnostic criteria of <dis>AHC</dis>.
Results
12 cases fulfilled criteria of <dis>typical AHC</dis> and 5 were atypical.
Mean age at diagnosis was 26 months.
47% cases had a family history of migraine.
Mean age at onset of hemiplegic attacks was 9.6 months.
Symptoms disappeared during sleep and precipitating factors were present in 94% cases.
Most patients developed <dis>mental retardation</dis> with <dis>ataxia</dis> and <dis>dysarthria</dis>.
Work-up tests (metabolic, neurophysiologic and radiologic) were normal or nonspecific.
In 3 patients mutations in _CACNA1A, ATP1A2_ were ruled out.
Positive responses to flunarizine was observed in 81%.
Conclusions
The characteristic clinical symptoms are still the clue to make the diagnosis of this mysterious disease, with a lack of genetic, biochemical or radiological specific studies.
Early diagnosis avoids invasive tests, repeating procedures, using ineffective and potentially toxic treatments, and allows to start treatment with flunarizine without delay.
More genetic studies are needed in broader series of patients.Abstract
 Background
The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a disease of genetic origin.
It is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, hypogonadism, hiperfagia leading to obesity, low stature, <dis>developmental delay</dis>, <dis>moderate mental retardation</dis>, <dis>abnormal behavior</dis> and characteristic facial appearance.
It is caused by the loss or the inactivation of paternal genes of the imprinted region 15q11-13.
There are different genetic causes: paternal 15q11-q13 deletion in 70% of patients, maternal uniparental disomy in the 20-25% and less than 5% have an imprinting defect.
We present the results obtained in the transverse clinical - genetic study of 77 PWS patients.
Patients and methods
There has been realized the study of 374 suspected PWS patients.
Cytogenetics studies of bands G and hybridization in situ fluorescent (FISH) and molecular genetics analysis of microsatellites, Southern blot, MS-PCR and sequenciation were carried out.
Holm's criteria use for the correlation phenotype - genotype in 48 patients.
Results
PWS was confirmed in 77 patients, 46 deletion, 16 uniparental disomy, two imprinting defect and 13 only PWS methylation pattern.
Significant differences do not observe in the correlation phenotype - genotype.
Conclusions
The frequencies of the molecular alterations, 71.87 % deletion, 25 % UPD and 3.12 % DI, they are similar to described in the literature.
It presents the algorithm of diagnosis used with the MS-PCR as rapid technology to confirm PWS.Abstract
 Background and objetive
Brain creatine (Cr) deficiencies are a group of inborn errors of metabolism that are characterized by an absence or severe reduction of brain Cr.
Clinically, these patients can display <dis>psychomotor/mental retardation</dis> and <dis>language disorders</dis>, commonly associated with epilepsy or <dis>movement disorders</dis>.
Three metabolic defects are known: two affect synthesis – guanidinoacetate metiltransferase (GAMT) and glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiencies– and one affect the Cr transporter (CRTR).
We present the first three Spanish patients with GAMT deficiency, and we compare their clinical phenotype and treatment response with other published cases.
Patients and method
The three patients presented <dis>mental retardation</dis>, epilepsy and <dis>autistic behaviour</dis>.
Patient 1 also had severe chorea.
Diagnosis was done by biochemical and genetic procedures (guanidinoacetate quantification, determination of GAMT activity and mutation analysis in the GAMT gene).
Results
An increase of guanidinoacetate was detected in urine and plasma.
Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed low Cr levels.
Enzymatic studies revealed a decreased GAMT activity in fibroblasts.
Molecular analysis detected pathogenic mutations in the GAMT gene.
After the deficiency was confirmed, the patients started treatment with Cr.
In addition, patient 2 and 3 received an arginine-restricted diet and ornithine supplements.
All them showed a partial improvement.
Conclusions
Patients with GAMT deficiency have an unspecific but relatively constant clinical presentation.
Brain Cr deficiency should be considered in patients with <dis>mental retardation</dis> of unknown aetiology, specially in those with <dis>movement disorders</dis> or epilepsy.
Early diagnosis is important in cases with known treatment such as GAMT deficiency.Abstract
 Background and objetive
A broad spectrum of clinical disorders is produced by mutations in the DNA polymerase gamma mitochondrial ( _POLG_ ) gene which are associated with altered mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity.
The majority of disorders characterized by multiple mtDNA deletions present with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, though this feature is not usually found in syndromes caused by mtDNA depletion.
We report on a patient having the clinical triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, <dis>dysarthria</dis> and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO), _POLG_ mutations and reduced muscle mtDNA content.
Patient and methods
The patient presented with sensory ataxic neuropathy, <dis>dysarthria</dis> and ophthalmoplegia.
Diagnosis was established by using histological and genetic procedures (nerve biopsy, mtDNA molecular analysis in skeletal muscle and mutation screening in the _POLG_ gene).
Results
Sural nerve biopsy showed marked loss of large myelinated fibers.
Skeletal muscle analysis revealed multiple mtDNA deletions, a marked decrease in mtDNA copy number and pathogenic mutations in the _POLG_ gene.
Conclusions
 _POLG_ mutations must be considered in all patients with the cardinal findings of the SANDO phenotype, without taking into account the type of abnormalities encountered in the mitochondrial genome.Abstract
 This review focuses on the neuropsychiatric manifestations (<dis>personality disturbances</dis>, depressive symptoms, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis>), which have been described in this last decade in patients with essential tremor.
We compared the data derived from the Neurologic Disorders in Central Spain (NEDICES) study, a prospective population-based survey, with those derived from the literature.
The traditional view of essential tremor as a mono- symptomatic condition characterized by action tremor is now changing.
First, it is known that many patients also have other motor manifestations apart from tremor (e.g., <dis>ataxic gait</dis>).
Second, in the last years, the presence of a variety of non-motor neuropsychiatric features has been described.
Mild cognitive changes (especially executive dysfunction) have been documented in several independent studies.
Further, two population-based studies have demonstrated an association between essential tremor with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis>.
Psychiatric manifestations include specific personality traits, anxiety, social phobia, and depressive symptoms.
Taking together, the neuropsychiatric dysfunction pattern and the new data on neuropathology of essential tremor suggest that this disease is a neurodegenerative cerebellar disorder and let us to question the classical concept of essential tremor as a benign mono-symptomatic disorder.Abstract
 Background and objectives
To determine the use of oral anticoagulants in polypathological patients with atrial fibrillation and its influence on mortality and <dis>loss of functionality</dis>.
Patients and methods
Patients with polypathological patient criteria and atrial fibrillation were included in an observational, prospective and multicenter study.
Data on demographic, clinical, functional and sociofamilial characteristics, CHADS2 score, levels of hemoglobin, albumin and creatinine, use of oral anticoagulants and survival and functional status at one year were collected.
Results
Five hundred and thirty-two (32.6%) of 1,632 polypathological patients had atrial fibrillation.
The stroke risk was high in 505 (94.9%), moderate in 24 (4.5%) and low in 3 (0.6%) patients.
Oral anticoagulants were used in 61% of patients with CHADS2 score ≥ 2 and in 37.5% with CHADS2 score = 1\.
Oral anticoagulants were less used in older patients, with more <dis>functional and cognitive impairment</dis>.
Heart failure was associated with more use of oral anticoagulants.
There was no difference by the presence of hypertension, diabetes, anemia, renal insufficiency or stroke.
In multivariate analysis the use of oral anticoagulants was independently associated with lower age, lower <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, absence of hepatic disease and with higher stroke risk.
The prescription of oral anticoagulants was independently associated with more survival at one year with no influence on functional status.
Conclusions
Oral anticoagulants are underused in polypathological patients with atrial fibrillation despite being associated with more survival.
Abstract
 In the last few years, there has been an explosion of new drugs acting on the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS) but less attention has been paid to better knowledge of the symptoms of this disease and their pathogenesis and treatment, which is essential to improve patients’ quality of life.
Because many patients have numerous concurrent symptoms during their clinical course, their management is complex and consequently it is important to know which symptoms are a direct result of the degenerative lesions of MS.
The present article describes all the therapeutic options available for spasticity and its associated pain, paroxystic symptoms, fatigue, genitourinary disorders and sexual dysfunction, tremor, <dis>ataxia</dis>, <dis>gait disorder</dis> and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, with special emphasis on novel treatments.
The article also defines exacerbations, how to recognize them and the available treatments, mainly oral administration of high–dose methylprednisolone and plasmapheresisAbstract
 Background
Cigarette smoking is a modifiable risk factor for <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, while the relationship between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> is not fully understood.
The objectives were to identify a possible association between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> depending on age in the Chinese rural population.
Methods
Data for the study consisted of 1,782 participants (40 years and older) who lived in a rural village in the vicinity of Xi’an, China.
Data about smoking history and cognitive function were collected.
Cognitive function was scored by the Mini-Mental State Examination.
The effect of age on the relationship between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was analyzed with interaction and stratified analysis by logistic regression models.
Results
Interaction analysis showed that current smoking is positively related with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (odds ratio [OR] = 9.067; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.305-62.979; _P_ = .026).
However, the interaction term, age by current smoking, is negatively related with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (OR = 0.969; 95%CI 0.939-0.999; _P_ = .045).
Stratified logistic regression showed that in the 40-65 years of age sublayer, OR of current smoking is 1.966 ( _P_ = .044), whereas in the > 65 years of age sublayer, the OR is 0.470 ( _P_ = .130).
This means that the association between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> with age might be positive (OR > 1) in lower age sublayers, but no significant difference in higher age sublayers.
Conclusions
In conclusion, current smoking might be positively associated with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in the middle-aged but the relationship declines with increasing age.Abstract
 Background and objective
Functional assessment is especially relevant in patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>CI</dis>).
The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale assesses functional ability and its use is becoming increasingly popular.
This study aims to perform the translation and cultural adaptation of the DAD scale in order to create a Spanish version: DAD-E.
Patients and method
A double translation/back-translation process was developed, as well as a pilot study with 14 caregivers of patients with <dis>CI</dis>, and 3 review meetings to achieve general agreement.
Results
The DAD-E includes the 40 original items.
Four response options and 8 scores were added in order to detect <dis>functional disability</dis> induced by <dis>CI</dis> independently of other possible causes.
More detailed instructions for administration and scoring of the scale have been provided in order to improve the reliability of the content.
Conclusions
The DAD-E was shown to be a cultural and linguistic adaptation equivalent of the original scale, which allows it to be applied to the Spanish population.
It may be a useful instrument in clinical practice since it provides a more accurate assessment of <dis>functional disability</dis> due to <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.Background and objective.
Dual diagnosis is the coexistence of an addictive disorder and another <dis>mental disorder</dis>. 
The objective is to estimate cravings and self-reported quality of life in a sample of patients with alcoholic dependence, with or without dual pathology, who attend an outpatient treatment centre.

Patients and method.
A cross-sectional study of 112 patients (56 dual and 56 non-dual), diagnosed with alcohol dependence according to DSM-IV-TR. 
The presence of cravings is determined by the Multidimensional Alcohol Craving Scale and quality of life through the SF-36 Health Questionnaire.

Results.
There are no statistically significant differences in cravings in either subgroup; the latter tend to refer to lower alcohol cravings than non-dual patients. 
The dual patients have a worse quality of life in all categories evaluated, highlighting a worse quality of life in the categories: social function, emotional role, vitality and general health. 
Females present a lower quality of life emphasising those of social function and emotional role. 
No differences were detected in relation to cravings between the 2 groups.

Conclusions.
In order to perform a correct clinical and therapeutic approach for patients with alcohol dependence, we should consider focusing on the evaluation of cravings and quality of life. 
In order to perform a correct clinical and therapeutic approach for patients with alcohol dependence, it is necessary to consider cravings and quality of life, since these parameters are important for the evaluation of patients with alcohol dependence.
Abstract
 Anaemia is common in the elderly and is associated with an increased risk of <dis>physical, functional, and cognitive impairment</dis>, hospitalisation and mortality.
Although it is unknown whether anaemia is a causal factor or a subrogated marker of worse health status, its correction can improve the patients’ physical and functional capacity.
Detection, classification, and treatment of anaemia should be a priority for the health system.
The main causes of anaemia in the elderly are nutritional deficiencies and chronic disease, with or without kidney failure, although some cases are of indeterminate origin.
Medical history and physical examination help to clarify its aetiology.
A diagnostic algorithm based on data from the lab allows anaemia classification with a therapeutic orientation.
Supplements of iron and maturation factors, as well as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, constitute the mainstay of treatment, along with that of the underlying disease, whereas red blood cell transfusion should be reserved for severe cases.Introduction and objective
Asthma is a chronic disease requiring inhaled treatment and in addition it is a risk factor (RF) of pneumonia. 
In the oropharyngeal cavity there are numerous species of bacteria that could be dragged to the bronco-alveolar level.
Objective
to decide whether oral health is a community acquired pneumonia (CAP) RF in asthmatic patients who are taking inhaled treatment, and determining whether the frequency of use of inhalation devices and the type of inhaled drug are CAP RF.
Patients and method
Case-control study in asthmatic population with inhaled treatment. 
We recruited 126 asthmatic patients diagnosed with pneumonia by clinical and radiological criteria (cases) and 252 asthmatics not diagnosed with pneumonia during the last year (controls), matched by age. 
The main factor of study was the General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) score.
Results
Bivariated analysis showed a statistically significant association of CAP with a GOHAI score≤57 points (poor oral health) (OR 1.69), anticholinergic treatment (OR 2.41), 6 or more inhalations (3.23), chamber use (OR 1.62), FEV1 (OR 0.98), altered functionality (OR 2.08) and <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis> or depression (OR 0.41). 
The multivariated analysis shows an independent association of performing 6 or more inhalations per day (OR 2.74) and <dis>functional impairment</dis> (OR 1.67).
Conclusions
The results suggest that poor oral health may be a CAP RF.The encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is characterized by the presence of antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of this receptor, resulting in symptoms that are similar to those observed in models of genetic or pharmacologic reduction of NMDARs. 
Patients are usually young adults, predominantly women, and children who develop, in a sequential manner, rapidly progressive symptoms including psychosis, <dis>abnormal movements</dis>, <dis>autonomic dysfunction</dis>, and coma. 
Epileptic seizures are variable and can occur throughout the course of the disease. 
The disease is often mistaken as viral encephalitis, <dis>primary psychiatric disorders</dis>, drug abuse, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 
About 50% of young women have an ovarian teratoma; in young girls and men the presence of a tumour is infrequent. 
In some patients, the disease is triggered by herpes simplex encephalitis. 
The recognition of anti-NMDAR encephalitis is important because, despite its severity, most patients respond to immunotherapy.Treatment of osteoporosis should be directed primarily towards secondary prevention of fractures.
The occurrence of drug-related adverse effects for the treatment of osteoporosis has led to a reevaluation of the indications, the duration of treatment and even withdrawal of some drugs from the market.
This review has been made from different patient profiles that practitioners will find in usual practice; from patients with hip fracture with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, <dis>limitation of their day-to-day living activities</dis> and comorbidities, to active patients without any limitations; patients with vertebral fractures and non-vertebral fractures where secondary prevention is highly important.
In general, antiresorptive drugs (alendronate and risedronate) will be the first choice. 
Zoledronate or denosumab will be indicated in cases of digestive intolerance, poor adherence or an increased risk of hip fracture. 
Teriparatide will be indicated to patients with 2or more previous vertebral fractures or very low bone density.<dis>Sudden deafness</dis> owing to labyrinth hemorrhage is a relatively rare clinical entity; labyrinth hemorrhage may be the only demonstrable finding in neuroimaging studies performed for <dis>sudden deafness</dis>, whether as an isolated finding or associated with labyrinthitis, manifesting as labyrinth hyperintensity in T1-weighted MRI sequences without enhancement after contrast administration.
We present a case in which cochlear hemorrhage caused <dis>sudden deafness</dis> in a previously asymptomatic 22-year-old woman.
We review the literature and evaluate the role of the presence of hyperintensity in cranial MRI.Objective
To analyze the diagnostic accuracy of protón magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and to establish the usefulness of complementary information provided by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Material and methods
64 patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n=31), <dis>vascular dementia</dis> (n=6), <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>) (n=9), and major depression (n=18), were studied.
All patients underwent cerebral MRI and single-volume 1H MRS using two echo times (TE, 31 and 136 ms) in the posterior cingulate gyrus and right temporal lobe.
The metabolites analyzed were N-acetylaspartate (NAA), myo-Inositol (mi), choline (Ch), and ere-atine (Cr), and the ratios of Ch/Cr, mI/Cr, NAA/mIand NAA/Cr were calculated.
In order to differentiate among the different types of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, the alterations in imaging and spectroscopy findings were graded from 0 to 4, as was the mean combination of the two, and then ROC curves were obtained.
Results
Statistically significant differences were found between the spectra of patients with <dis>dementia</dis> (AD and <dis>vascular dementia</dis>) and those <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>dementia</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis> and depression) in the posterior cingulate gyrus</scp>.
The NAA/ml ratio yielded the best área under the ROC curve, with the best sensitivity (82.5%) and specificity (72.7%) in the diagnosis of AD.
The NAA/mI and ml/Cr quotients differentiated between the four degenerative pathologies causing the <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
The combination of MRI and 1H MRS significantly improved the accuracy of the diagnosis of AD.
Conclusions
The metabolic differences found among patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> using 1H MRS can be useful for differentiating AD, <dis>vascular dementia</dis>, <dis>MCI</dis>, and depression.
The combination of spectroscopy and MRI findings is useful in the diagnosis of AD.Abstract
 We present the case of a 75-year-old woman who suddenly developed <dis>hemiplegia</dis>, <dis>aphasia</dis>, and reduced consciousness three hours after embolization of a cerebral aneurysm.
No complications occurred during embolization and the findings at end- procedure angiography were normal.
Cranial computed tomography (CT) after embolization showed hyperdensity of the cortex and sulci of the convexity; another CT examination performed four hours later showed these findings had disappeared.
Cerebral arteriography 24 h after embolization showed delayed blood flow to the parenchyma of the left hemisphere compared to the right but no vascular occlusion.
The neurological deficit lasted 72 h and resolved spontaneously and completely as suddenly as it developed.
This is one of the few cases of temporary neurological deficit related to iodinated contrast administration to be reported outside the posterior circulation (<dis>cortical blindness</dis>).
When neurological symptoms occur after endovascular procedures in the brain, it is fundamental to distinguish this rare clinical syndrome of probable toxic origin from possible ischemic complications of the procedure.Abstract
 Otosclerosis is a primary osteodystrophy of the temporal bone that causes <dis>progressive conductive hearing loss</dis>.
The diagnosis is generally clinical, but multidetector CT (MDCT), the imaging technique of choice, is sometimes necessary.
The objective of this article is to systematically review the usefulness of imaging techniques for the diagnosis and postsurgical assessment of otosclerosis, fundamentally the role of MDCT, to decrease the surgical risk.Summary
Background and objectives
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis starts between the fifth and sixth decades of life, causing degeneration and death of upper and lower motor neurons.
When the muscles responsible for ventilation are affected, the patient dies of respiratory failure within a few years.
Case report
This is a 63 years old female with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who underwent surgical treatment of a transtrochanteric fracture of the femur.
The patient presented weakness of upper and lower limbs and <dis>dysarthria</dis>, and she was awake and oriented.
Respiratory function: ineffective cough, decreased strength of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm, and reduction of the breath sounds in both lung bases.
Initially, the L3/L4 epidural space was punctured and a silicon catheter was introduced to 5 cm.
This was followed by a spinal puncture in the L4/L5 space and the administration of 7.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine.
This was followed by the administration of 37 mg of 0.37% ropivacaine through the epidural catheter for a sensitive blockade up to T10.
The procedure evolved without complications and the patient was discharged from the hospital after three days.
Conclusions
The evidence has demonstrated that neuroaxis blocks can be safely performed in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis since it avoids manipulation of the airways and respiratory complications.Abstract
 Bipolar disorder (BD) is a <dis>chronic psychiatric disorder</dis> that is found within the first ten causes of disability and premature mortality.
The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a group of risk factors (RF) that predispose to cardiovascular disease (CV), diabetes and early mortality.
Both diseases generate high costs to the health system.
Major studies have shown that MS has a higher prevalence in patients with <dis>mental disorders</dis> compared to the general population.
The incidence of MS in BD is multifactorial, and due to iatrogenic, genetic, economic, psychological, and behavioral causes related to the health system.
The most common RF found is these patients was an increased abdominal circumference, and it was found that the risk of suffering this disease was greater in women and Hispanic patients.
As regards the increase in RF to develop a CV in patients with BD, there have been several explanations based on the risky behavior of patients with <dis>mental illness</dis>, included tobacco abuse, physical inactivity and high calorie diets.
An additional explanation described in literature is the view of BD as a multisystemic inflammatory illness, supported by the explanation that inflammation is a crucial element in atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, platelet rupture, and thrombosis.
The pathophysiology of MS and BD include factors such as adrenal, thyroid and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, as well as poor lifestyle and medication common in these patients.
This article attempts to give the reader an overall view of the information published in literature to date, as regards the association between BD and MS.Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Cognitive decline</dis> could begin 20 years before the diagnosis of <dis>dementia</dis>.
Besides age, several factors related to medical, socioeconomic, and behavioral and genetic condition may be associated with <dis>cognitive decline</dis>.
The aim of this systematic review was to summarize evidence on the risk and protective factors for <dis>cognitive decline</dis> in people under 65 years old.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted using a search strategy in MEDLINE and Embase, including longitudinal studies to analyze the effect of protective or risk factors on <dis>cognitive decline</dis> in a population under 65 years old.
Results
A total of 22 studies were included in this review.
Factors such as diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, overweight or obesity, metabolic syndrome, education, physical activity, cognitive stimulation, marital status and diet, could be related to <dis>cognitive decline</dis> before 65 years of age.
Conclusions
Cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle conditions may be associated with <dis>cognitive decline</dis> before 65 years of age.
However, the quality of the evidence was low.Abstract
 Background
The perceived stigma represents a sociocultural barrier to access mental health services and prevents individuals who meet criteria for a <dis>mental disorder</dis> the possibility of receiving comprehensive and integred care.
Objective
To update institutional mechanisms by which stigma related to <dis>mental disorders</dis>, perceived and perpetrated, acts as a barrier to mental health access.
Results
Stigma as a barrier to access to mental health services is due to a reduction in service requests, the allocation of limited resources to mental health, the systematic process of impoverishment of the people who suffer a <dis>mental disorder</dis>, increased risk of crime, and implications in contact with the legal system, and the invisibility of the vulnerability of these people.
Conclusions
Structured awareness and education programs are needed to promote awareness about <dis>mental disorders</dis>, promote community-based psychosocial rehabilitation, and reintegration into productive life process.
In Colombia, the frequency and variables associated with the stigma of <dis>mental disorders</dis> needs to be studied.
This knowledge will enable the implementation of measures to promote the social and labor inclusion of people who meet the criteria for <dis>mental disorders</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
Age at onset of bipolar disorder has been reported as a variable that may be associated with different clinical subtypes.
Objective
To identify patterns in the distributions of age at onset of bipolar disease and to determine whether age at onset is associated with specific clinical characteristics.
Methods
Admixture analysis was applied to identify bipolar disorder subtypes according to age at onset.
The EMUN scale was used to evaluate clinical characteristics and principal components were estimated to evaluate the relationship between subtypes according to age at onset and symptoms in the acute in the acute phase, using multivariable analyses.
Results
According to age at onset, three distributions have been found: early onset: 17.7 years (S.D. 2.4); intermediate-onset: 23.9 years (S.D. 5.6); late onset: 42.8 years (S.D. 12.1).
The late-onset group is antisocial, with depressive symptoms, <dis>thinking and language disorders</dis>, and socially disruptive behaviors.
Conclusions
In patients having bipolar disorder, age at onset is antisocial with three groups having specific clinical characteristics.
Abstract
 Introduction
Liver transplantation is a treatment available for many patients with liver cirrhosis who find in this treatment a way to improve life expectancy and quality of life.
Paranoid schizophrenia affects 1% of the general population, produces psychotic symptoms, and runs a chronic course in some cases with significant deterioration in all areas of life.
Objective
To discuss the case of a patient with liver cirrhosis diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during the evaluation protocol for liver transplantation.
Method
Case report.
Results
We report the case of a 47-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis whose only alternative to improve life expectancy and quality of life was access to liver transplantation.
During routine evaluations the liaison psychiatrist observed first-order psychotic symptoms and documented a life story that confirmed the presence of paranoid schizophrenia.
Discussion and Conclusions
Paranoid schizophrenia is a <dis>psychiatric disorder</dis> common in the general population that can be a part of the medical comorbidities of patients requiring liver transplantation and is not an absolute contraindication to its completion.
We are unaware of similar cases of liver transplantation in patients with schizophrenia in our country.
We believe this is a big step on the road to overcome the stigma that <dis>mental illness</dis> imposes on patients.Abstract
 Introduction
Comorbidity studies of frequency of OCD or OCD symptoms and schizophrenia show very high variability.
The presence of these symptoms in schizophrenia has been related to factors like severity of disease.
The objective of this study is to estimate the frequency of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients having schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and to evaluate its relationship with clinical characteristics.
Results
A total of 222 patients have been evaluated using SANS, SAPS, BPRS, EMUN and Zung scales and the Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist.
No cases of OCD have been found.
The frequency of OCD symptoms was 4.5% (95% CI 2.2% 8.1%).
OCD symptoms were associated with <dis>social and cognitive impairment</dis>.
Conclusions
OCD and OCD symptoms represent distinct dimensions in schizophrenic patients.
Its presence in different stages of the disease could indicate impairment or protection against more disruptive signs of psychosis.Abstract
 Introduction
Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with <dis>significant impairment in social, work, and family functioning</dis>, even in euthymic state.
This could be explained by a <dis>social cognition deficit</dis>.
Objective
To review the findings on social cognition in bipolar patients through its main dimensions, and through the various stages of the illness.
_Method:_ We searched the biomedical literature on Medline, OVID, Proquest, and EMBASE for articles matching the MeSH terms “social cognition”, “theory of mind”, “emotion recognition”, “empathy”, and “emotional processing” to “bipolar disorder”, limiting the results to clinical studies with medium/high methodological quality, in Spanish or English and published in the last 20 years, in children and adults.
Results
We selected 83 items referring to this topic but only 24 specifically assessed social cognition in bipolar population.
Most studies showed a deficit in both the phases of relapse as well as in euthymic state.
_Discussion:_ From a neurocognitive perspective a number of explanations arise for this <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, associated with the existence of subsyndromal affective symptoms.
Finally, we review the rehabilitation strategies that could be useful to reverse this deficit that carries important functional implications.Abstract
 Introduction
Colombia is experiencing an aging of its population.
In Risaralda the population over 65 years of age by the year 2005 was 63,668, according to projections by DANE for the year 2010 it was 73,510.
Students and faculty from different programs of the Technological University of Pereira, have been engaged in a variety of actions in order to encourage the participation of the elderly in welfare centers in physical, artistic, cultural, and social activities to improve their quality of life.
Methods
This quasi-experimental research evaluated the impact of these interventions on the quality of life of older adults in each of the protection centers by the application of the COOP/WONCA test.
The exclusion criteria were: Having some kind of restriction that affected the quality of information provided or that completely prevented its communication (<dis>memory problems</dis> or <dis>dementia</dis>).
Only six people were excluded.
Results
We did a ranges test to assess quality of life before and after the interventions and obtained more negative ranges (47) than positive ones(26).
Conclusions
According to these results there was an increase in the quality of life in the elderly which cannot be attributed to a particular intervention, but to the contact with other people.Abstract
 Introduction
The relationship between <dis>mental disorder</dis> and burns is complex.
<dis>Mental disorders</dis> may predispose to burns and burns can facilitate the development of <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
Method
Case report and literature review.
Results
We present four cases of women with self-inflicted burns and psychotic symptoms.
The average age of these women was 39.2 years.
Burns were caused by flames in 100% of the cases and 27.2% of the total body surface was burned.
Three of the patients (75%) had a bipolar disorder with mixed symptoms and in 50 of the patients the <dis>mental illness</dis> debuted with the self-inflicted burns.
Conclusions
Basic psychopathology that may explain the occurrence of the injury and could hamper the process of recovery and rehabilitation should be explored in all burned patients.Abstract
 Introduction
Mortality rates in patients suffering from burns have decreased, and the challenge now is quality of life of survivors, who have a high prevalence of <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
Objective
To describe the prevalence of depersonalization disorder in burned patients.
Methods
Review of the literature published on the subject, using the databases Medline, Ovid and Tripdatabase.
Results
It is well documented that dissociative symptoms including depersonalization accompany acute stress reactions that are triggered by major trauma, and that cognitive styles predispose certain individuals exposed to trauma to develop psychopathology, mostly posttraumatic stress disorder.
Conclusion
Despite this knowledge few studies have been conducted to establish the prevalence of phenomena of depersonalization-derealization in burned patients.Abstract
 Introduction
Socio-demographic and genetic factors have been involved in the development of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and its progression to <dis>dementia</dis>.
Method
The present study evaluates socio-demographic characteristics and the ApoE genotype in individuals older than 55 years with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), attending a memory clinic.
Results
155 individuals (36%) out of the total population who attended the memory clinic in a four-year period met the inclusion criteria.
The study population was classified in diagnostic groups according to the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-IV-TR) and to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NICNCDS-ADRDA) criteria.
More AD and <dis>MCI</dis> individuals worked in mainly manual occupations throughout their lifetime compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals ( _p_ =0.014).
A high percentage of individuals with <dis>MCI</dis> and of cognitively unimpaired individuals (43%) left their primary occupation or changed it for a mainly manual occupation after their retirement.
No other factors associated to the <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, including ApoE genotype, were found.
Conclusion
These results support a correlation between the primary occupation during lifetime and the development of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in individuals older than 55 years.Abstract
 Introduction
Poverty has been associated in some studies with poorer outcomes in <dis>mental problems and disorders</dis>.
A circular relationship has been considered in which poverty fosters the appearance of <dis>mental illness</dis> and this facilitates greater poverty.
There are no studies in Colombia on this subject.
Objective
To describe the association between <dis>mental problems and disorders</dis> and poverty according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in Colombia.
Material and methods
Using the 2015 National Mental Health Survey, adjusted with the expansion factors for the population.
The prevalences of mental problems and disorders obtained through semi-structured interviews employing the instruments SRQ-20, AUDIT C and A, modified PCL, familiar APGAR and CIDI CAPI.
The poverty status was determined by the MPI.
Results
A total of 13,200 households were interviewed, of which 13.5% were classified as in a poverty condition, 6.3% of the adolescents of poor households reported a life-time prevalence of any <dis>mental disorder</dis>, and 4.6% in the last 12 months.
On the other hand, the prevalences for the same age group not in a poverty condition were 7.2% and 3.3%, respectively.
For adults in poverty, the prevalence of life-time <dis>mental disorders</dis> were 9.2%, with 4.3% in the last year, while those not considered poor showed prevalences of 9.1% and 3.9% for the same time periods.
Conclusions
For the population of Colombia, there is a relationship between not being able to access the basic basket of goods and the presence of <dis>mental diseases</dis>, although there does not seems to be an association between an increase in poverty and the deterioration of mental health.Abstract
 Introduction
Hypothyroidism results from inadequate production of thyroid hormone.
It is known that there is a relationship between the <dis>major psychiatric disorders</dis> and hypothyroidism.
Objective
To determine the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients admitted due to <dis>major psychiatric disorders</dis> in Montserrat Hospital during the period from March to October 2010.
Material and methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 patients admitted to Montserrat Hospital with a primary diagnosis of <dis>major psychiatric disorder</dis> (major depression, bipolar affective disorder, generalised panic disorder, panic disorder, mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, and schizophrenia) in the aforementioned period.
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) was performed to assess the evidence of hypothyroidism.
Results
The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism was found to be 10.5% (95% CI; 5%-16%).
It was 12.5% in anxiety disorder, 11.1% in depressive disorder, with a lower prevalence of 10.3% for bipolar disorder, and 9.9% for schizophrenia.
Conclusions
The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism was found to be less than in the general population, which is between 4.64% and 18.5%, and hypothyroidism was found in disorders other than depression.Human behaviours have different meanings according to the historical moment and context. 
In this article sexual behaviours are taken as a category in order to analyse how psychiatric nosology is structured, as manifested in texts such as the DSM-5. 
The development of these diagnostic manuals are tools that are far from being free of subjectivities and interference of elements of power, expressed in the way health, illness, mental health, and <dis>mental disorders</dis>, are assumed; in short, the normal and pathological.
Each new diagnosis, or even its elimination, and the recomposing of the different diagnostic criteria, especially in the field of sexual behaviour, present visions of how individual and collective human life is conceived, as well as an expression of accurate attempts to control human sexualities through the medicalisation of behaviour, coupled with moral, religious, and even legal considerations.
Categories such as gender dysphoria, paraphilia or paraphilic disorders are examples of how the limits intended to establish a biomedical perspective are also incomplete and imprecise. 
These violate individual and social construction of sexualities and the conception of mental health, showing persistent difficulties and controversies that are evident in the way psychiatric classifications are made.Objective.
To analyse of the relationship between burden of illness and coping strategies and the demographic variables of caregivers, and the demographic and clinical variables of people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Methods.
Multicentre correlational cross-sectional study including 70 people diagnosed with schizophrenia, or a schizoaffective disorder, and 70 primary informal caregivers. 
They were evaluated using Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory, Family Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the brief Disability Assessment Scale.

Results.
Burden of illness positively associated with patient <dis>impairment in occupational and social functioning</dis>, and negatively with education level. 
Avoidance, coercion and positive communication were positively associated with <dis>impairment in occupational and social functioning</dis> of patients. 
Social interest and friendships showed a positive association with the education level of caregivers. 
Spiritual assistance negatively correlated with <dis>impairment in social functioning</dis> and patient age, and resignation was negatively associated with length of the disorder and patient education level.

Conclusions.
Burden and dysfunctional coping strategies, such as avoidance and coercion, are associated with <dis>functional impairment</dis> of the patient. 
These findings suggest the need to provide support to caregivers, adjusted to the functional level of the patient, in order to prevent burden of care.
Objective.
To determine the perception that some general clinical practitioners have about depressive syndrome in a region of Colombia.

Methodology.
The qualitative approach was established as a basis for this study using grounded theory for the description, analysis, and interpretation of data collected in 20 semi-structured interviews aimed at general medical practitioners who had treated patients with depressive syndrome in their clinical practice.

Results.
Throughout the interviews, some essential elements are highlighted such as: “seeing beyond a body,” where the interest of the physician is reflected by individualising each patient case because regardless of having the same disease, knowing that not all can be addressed or treated equally. 
“From insignificant to terrifying” shows that the network of experiences, experiences, emotions, and desires that make up part of the physician, are reflected in the compassion that he has for patient with depression, a situation that makes him confront as a human being before the suffering of others. 
In contrast appears the “my hands are tied” with a health system that prevents proper care of these patients, and generates problems for the treating physician.

Conclusions.
The malleable and unfinished scenario where the physicians interact with the depressive syndrome, allows them to understand their humanity while reflecting on the possibilities, limitations, meanings, attitudes and actions that they have about this disorder that is reflected in the ability of general physicians to diagnose and treat depression that is not necessarily associated with age or experience in practice. 
However, errors in care can be reduced with sufficient knowledge and an appropriate approach to <dis>mental illness</dis>.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the auditory hallucinatory experience in a clinical sample of patients with psychiatric symptoms (e.g. Schizophrenia), a religious group (eg. Christians) and a “control” group (<scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>mental disorder</dis></scp> and non-religious). 
The sample consisted of individuals of both sexes. 
The patient sample was recruited in two psychiatric hospitals of Buenos Aires City, the religious from an evangelical cult, and people with no religious beliefs or previous psychiatric symptoms (control group). 
The Hallucinatory Experiences Questionnaire and the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory Feelings and Experiences were the measurement tools used. 
The White Christmas Test was also administered in order to assess the degree of vivid imagery hearing based on a version of signal detection paradigm in which the subjects think that they hear a song in the background of white noise. 
The results showed that patients showed greater attributional bias (compared with evangelicals and the control group), but the religious group also tended to show greater bias (although less) than the control group. 
In addition, patients tended to show greater schizotypal and hallucinatory experiences compared with the evangelicals and the control group, but surprisingly, the control group showed higher negative schizotypy than the religious group, which indicates that religious practices could help reduce the negative effects of schizotypy.Introduction
Although the social and economic consequences of Colombian internal conflicts mainly affected the civilian population, they also had other implications. 
The ex-combatants, the other side of the conflict, have been the subject of many studies that question their personality structures and antisocial features. 
Results suggest that ex-combatants usually have characteristics of an <dis>antisocial personality disorder</dis> (<dis>ASPD</dis>) that is related with their behaviour.
Methods
Quantitative EEG (qEEG) was used to evaluate differences in cortical activity patterns between an ex-combatants group and a control group. 
The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) was used to assess the presence of <dis>ASPD</dis> in the ex-combatants group, as well as the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) for other <dis>mental disorders</dis> classified in the DCI-10.
Results
There are significant differences in psychopathy levels between groups, as well as in alpha-2 and beta waves, especially in left temporal and frontal areas for alpha-2 waves and left temporal-central regions for beta waves.
Conclusions
qEEG measurements allow spectral resting potential to be differentiated between groups that are related with features typically involved in <dis>antisocial personality disorder</dis>, and to correlate them with patterns in the questionnaires and clinical interview.Introduction.
Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome with severe consequences, especially for elderly patients with <dis>pre-existing cognitive impairment</dis>.

Methodology.
Descriptive study of one retrospective cohort, with the aim of comparing risk factors and mortality between surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment in a group of hospitalised patients with delirium.

Results.
Of the 184 hospitalised patients with delirium analysed, 29.3% were for surgical causes and 70.7% for non-surgical causes. 
Just over half (50.5%) were women, and 50% of the patients were 74 years or less (interquartile range, 27 years), with statistical differences (P=.002). 
Prior <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was observed in 42.9% of patients, with a greater proportion of non-surgical (50.8% vs 24.1%) with significant differences (P=.001). 
Anticholinergic medications were received by 89.7% of patients, and almost all of them (99.5%) received three or more medicines, with no significant differences. 
Half (50%) of the patients remained in hospital for 16.3 days or less (interquartile range, 23 days). 
Hospitalisation was significantly longer in the surgical group (P<.001). 
The hospital mortality was 14.7%, with no statistical differences between groups (P=.073).

Discussion.
Although there were no significant differences in mortality between the groups, it was higher in the non-surgical (17.7% vs. 7.4%). 
Increased mortality was found in the older group (non-surgical) that also had significantly greater <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, which coincides with that in the scientific literature.
Social cognition in schizophrenia is currently one of the major fields of interest in studies of this disorder. 
It is commonly conceptualised as a set of mental operations underlying social interactions, and therefore related to the ability to interpret and predict the behaviour of others in different social contexts. 
The research community has defined the functional areas that constitute the domain of social cognition, including, at least, the theory of mind, sensory perception, social perception, and attributional bias. 
Different bodies of evidence have shown that alterations in these functions in patients with schizophrenia are linked to some of their main <dis>psychopathological dysfunctions</dis>, such as <dis>defects in sensory perception</dis>, insight and attributional origin, and authorship of human acts. 
These behavioural alterations have been linked to <dis>structural and functional disturbances</dis> in the constituents of the so-called social brain. 
This includes a set of medial parietal, temporal, and pre-frontal areas that have been associated with some anomalies in the theory of mind, the perception of emotions, and the ability to consider the perspective of others, phenomena commonly found in schizophrenia. 
Future research in the domain of social cognition should be aimed at clarifying its relationship with the social brain and neurocognition.Objectives.
The present research aims to describe the knowledge of elementary school teachers about <dis>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</dis> (<dis>ADHD</dis>) through interviews about general information, symptoms/diagnosis and treatment, in addition to perceived self-efficacy.

Methods.
A descriptive cross-sectional population study was carried out, involving 62 teachers from public schools in the municipality of Sabaneta. 
The teachers were evaluated by the Spanish adaptation of the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (KADDS), an estimation scale composed of 36 items of three alternative answers (true, false and I do not know).

Results.
Teachers correctly answered a little less than half of the items in the total questionnaire (48.52%). 
Specifically, it was in the subscale of dymptoms/diagnosis in which they presented more hits with 69.35%, followed by the treatment subscale (45.30%), and finally the general information (38.60%).

Conclusions.
According to the data obtained, the need for interventions on the subject is confirmed, so that this is reflected in new teaching techniques that facilitate the learning and development of children with the disorder.
Objective
To establish the validity and reliability of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in Spanish (MoCA-S) to identify <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>) and <dis>dementia</dis> in the Mexican elderly population.
Material and methods
168 participants from a memory clinic in Mexico City were enrolled and divided into 3 groups: 59 cognitively healthy (CHG), 52 with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>MCI</dis>) (DSM-5 criteria) and 57 with <dis>dementia</dis> (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria). 
The MoCA-S and Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) were applied at baseline and during the last months to establish intra-observer reliability. 
ROC curves and a multinomial regression model were constructed to evaluate the effect of age and education on MoCA-S performance.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 76±8.1 years and the education rate was 10.7±5.2. 
The MoCA-S scores by group were: CHG, 27.3±1.9; MCI, 22.9±2.9; and <dis>dementia</dis>, 13.7±4.9 (p<0.001). 
The reliability of the MoCA-S was 0.89 and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.955. 
Sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 75%, with a cut-off point of 26 points for <dis>MCI</dis> (area under the curve, 0.886; p<0.001). 
For the <dis>dementia</dis> group, the sensitivity was 98% and specificity was 93%, with a cut-off point of 24points (area under the curve, 0.998; p<0.001). 
The multinomial regression showed no association with education and age for both the <dis>MCI</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis> groups.
Conclusions
The MoCA-S is a valid and reliable instrument for <dis>MCI</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis> screening in the Mexican population, even after adjusting for age and education.Some diseases secondary to inborn errors of metabolism are associated with <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis> or minor neurological symptoms. 
The existence of some cases with exclusively psychiatric symptoms represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. 
The aim of this article is to describe seven treatable neurometabolic disorders that should be taken into account in the psychiatric consultation as they manifest with psychiatric symptoms that mask the organic origin of the disorder. 
Homocysteine metabolism and urea cycle disorders, Wilson's disease, Niemann-Pick disease Type C, acute porphyria and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are described. 
Following an analysis of the literature, a list of psychiatric symptoms associated with these disorders are proposed, ranging from insidious changes in affective state and thought to atypical symptoms such as visual hallucinations, as well as paradoxical effects of antipsychotics or <dis>behavioural disorders</dis> in children and adolescents associated with <dis>loss of autonomy</dis>. 
The most frequently associated neurological signs, such as alterations in the state of consciousness, <dis>motor behaviour and balance disorders</dis>, catatonia or <dis>progressive cognitive deficit</dis> are also listed. 
Emphasis is placed on the importance of considering resistance to antipsychotic treatment as a warning sign to suspect organicity, as well as the significant improvement in <dis>psychiatric impairment</dis> when effective and early treatment is established.Introduction
<dis>Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder</dis> (<dis>ADHD</dis>) occurs more frequently in first-degree relatives. 
It is believed that this risk is not specific to this disorder but also occurs with other psychopathologies. 
The study of siblings of <dis>ADHD</dis> probands is an interesting field since they share common environmental factors.
Methods
This is a narrative literature review. 
A bibliographic search was performed on PubMed and PsychNet databases and topic-related publications were included without date of publication or study design limits.
Results
Siblings of patients with <dis>ADHD</dis> have a higher likelihood of having this disorder when compared to controls, with odds ratios (OR) ranging between 11.4 and 13.5. 
Among these siblings, <dis>ADHD</dis> prevalence ranges between 26 and 45.2%. 
Siblings with <dis>ADHD</dis> and those <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>ADHD</dis></scp> have an increased risk of having other disorders, the most frequent being oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).
Conclusions
Siblings of people with <dis>ADHD</dis> have an increased risk of having the same disorder. 
The risk of having another <dis>psychiatric disorder</dis> markedly increases when the sibling also presents <dis>ADHD</dis>; this is especially true for ODD, substance use disorder and bipolar disorder.The association of nervous system with skin is well documented. 
Many <dis>common psychiatric disorders</dis> can involve skin either directly or indirectly. 
We found an association of 13 <dis>primary psychiatric disorders</dis> leading to dermatological diseases, with association of 2 of 13 considered to be idiopathic. 
Association of the mind and body has long been studied. 
Several skin problems lead to psychological and psychiatric symptoms, however not all skin problems lead to psychiatric symptoms. 
On the contrary, many <dis>primary psychiatric illnesses</dis> appear to have associated skin disorders.Objective.
Colombia is facing a rising epidemic of intravenous heroin use. 
Knowledge of the methadone-assisted treatment programs in the country is crucial in order to propose improvement strategies.

Methods.
13 programmes from priority regions were surveyed. 
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients attending the programs, a description of the services offered, their methadone treatment protocols, the various barriers to treatment and the causes of treatment abandonment were reviewed.

Results.
12/13 questionnaires were analysed with a total of 538 active patients. 
Most of the patients attending these programs were men (85.5%) between 18 and 34 years-old (70%). 
Forty percent (40%) were intravenous drug users and 25% admitted sharing needles. 
The comorbidities associated with heroin use were <dis>mental illness</dis> (48%), hepatitis C (8.7%) and HIV (2%). 
Psychiatric comorbidity was more likely in patients attending the private sector (69.8% vs 29.7%; p<0.03). 
The initial average dose of methadone administered was 25.3±8.9mg/day, with a maintenance dose ranging from 41 to 80mg/day. 
Lack of alignment with primary care was perceived to be the most serious barrier to access, ahead of problems with insurance and prejudice towards treatment with methadone (p<0.05). 
Health Administration and insurance problems (p<0.003), together with the lack of availability of methadone (p<0.018) and relapse (p<0.014) were the most important reasons for abandonment of treatment.

Conclusions.
The treatment protocols of these programmes offer different levels of development and implementation. 
Some of the barriers to access and reasons for abandonment of treatment with methadone can be mitigated with better health administration.
Objective.
To establish the occurrence of caregiver syndrome in caregivers of people with <dis>mental illness</dis> participating in the Day Hospital Program of a tertiary institution in the city of Cali.

Material and methods.
A descriptive, cross-sectional observational study was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of overload syndrome in 70 caregivers of people with <dis>mental illness</dis>, through interviews and the formal application of the Zarit scale and the WHO-DAS 2.0 questionnaire.

Results.
It was established that 68.6% of the participating population presented some level of overload. 
The caregiver profile corresponds to women, over the age of 55, who belonged to the subsidized health system; earning a low income, and with an average of 8 years in caregiver role for at least 12 hours per day. 
The long time dedicated to the role's activities and the level of demand resulting from the degree of disability of the person receiving care, appear as associated factors for the presence of higher levels of overload for the caregiver, for which they are a factor to consider when implementing interventions and research processes in which the caregiver is involved as a key agent for improving the quality of life of people with <dis>mental illness</dis>.
Introduction.
Diagnosing and treating <dis>autism</dis> and child psychoses is very difficult; these pathologies impact not only the child's life but also the family as a whole. 
Therefore caution is required when giving a diagnosis with prognostic implications. 
We use the psychodynamic perspective in order to take into consideration both pathological and healthy diagnostic aspects, and to promote evolutionary potential of each patient.

Objective.
To determine the inter-rater reliability and to test quantitatively and qualitatively the variables involved in the diagnoses of patients with suspected <dis>autism</dis> and child psychoses, based upon psychodynamic concepts.

Methods.
An inter-rater reliability study was carried on, based upon the diagnostic evaluation of videos of patients with suspected <dis>autism</dis> or child psychoses who attended the diagnostic meeting (observation session) at the Instituto de Ortopedia Infantil Roosevelt.

Results.
Kappa values were obtained, ranging from .24 to .50, with a reliability force varying from slight to moderate, and κ=.24 for personality organization. 
This type of diagnosis takes into account both the pathological and healthy aspects which make up personality organization. 
Finally, limitations and aspects that should be considered in further studies were discussed.

Conclusions.
The results reinforce the need to evaluate a child with major disorders in an interdisciplinary team, and but a single observer, in order to allow discussion, and debate, and therefore, avoid partial readings of the patient’ s psychological functioning.
Recovery in schizophrenia is a topic that generates not only major clinical attention but also a significant economic and social impact. 
Until seventy years ago, these patients remained held in psychiatric institutions or asylums, usually with no hope of reintegrating into the community. 
A narrative review of relevant literature was conducted in order to answer key questions regarding recovery in schizophrenia. 
Treatment objectives in schizophrenia have changed substantially: from expecting a modest control of psychotic symptoms to considering functional recovery as a possibility. 
Available evidence indicates that one in seven patients with schizophrenia will achieve functional recovery, which implies that remission of positive symptoms is not the ultimate goal of treatment but only a basis for better social and cognitive functioning that translates into better quality of life. 
This view until recently was not believed to be possible for this major <dis>mental disorder</dis>.Introduction
Medically unexplained symptoms are defined as physical symptoms that have been present for several weeks and that an adequate medical evaluation has not revealed any disease that explains them; when these symptoms become persistent, they lead to comprehensive clinical investigations and multiple interventions. 
These patients have a greater or at least comparable commitment to physical functioning, mental health, and negative health perception than patients with multiple chronic medical conditions; have significantly more stressful life events (psychological, physical and/or sexual abuse) and are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression.
Objective
To characterize sociodemographic and psychiatric characteristics of a group of patients identified in primary care with medically unexplained symptoms.
Methodology
A descriptive, cross-sectional study with patients from 18 to 70 years old who were given PHQ-15, PHQ-9 and PHQ for anxiety, and a survey designed for the study.
Results
36 patients were analysed, 94.4% women, median age 45 [RIC, 20] years-old, 33.3% married, 91.7% had children. 
55% had severe functional somatic symptoms, 77.8% had one or more <dis>functional somatic disorders</dis>, and 77.7% had clinically relevant affective or anxiety symptoms. 
25% of the patients reported a history of child abuse, 41.7% were mistreated by a partner, and 41.6% were victims of the Colombian armed conflict.
Conclusions
The main finding of this study was that 8 out of 10 patients met criteria for a <dis>functional somatic disorder with great symptomatic severity</dis> and three out of ten patients met criteria for two <dis>functional disorders</dis>, most of these patients without other basic medical diseases. 
In addition, we found a high prevalence of exposure to different types of violence that these patients have been subjected to throughout their life.Summary
Neurodegeneration associated with pantothenate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 gene (PANK2).
Clinical characteristics include <dis>progressive motor impairment</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis>.
Medical treatment is limited and the dystonia tends to be refractory, making stereotactic surgery with placement of deep-brain electrodes an option that is being adopted with greater frequency in these patients.
We report the case of a 32-year-old woman with severe dystonia associated with PANK2 protein deficiency.
The patient was scheduled for stereotactic bilateral placement of electrodes in the medial globus pallidus, guided by computed tomography and under general anesthesia, to treat the debilitating dystonia and generalized stiffness associated with her condition.
Anesthesia was maintained with propofol, rocuronium and remifentanil in perfusion during the intervention, which was uneventful.
After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and sedation was provided with remifentanil to allow slow, gradual emergence from anesthesia.
The patient was discharged from hospital after placement of the implanted pulse generator, and subsequent follow-up showed improvement of the dystonia.
Abstract
 We describe the case of a patient with severe lactic acidosis, as well as presenting some data on its incidence, diagnosis, prognostic factors, and the most appropriate treatment.
A 76 year-old male patient with diabetes on treatment with metformin, hypertension, dyslipaemia, and with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in a state of circulatory shock, requiring aggressive treatment with vasopressors and volume.
The patient had acute kidney injury with an anuria of 3 days, probably secondary to dehydration to vomiting and to NSAIDs.
As a result of the acute renal damage, the patient suffered a severe metformin-associated lactic acidosis.
The rest of the causes of metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap were ruled out, as well as a possible sepsis or rhabdomyolysis.
Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an uncommon metabolic condition, but with a high mortality.
To reduce the mortality of these patients, it is important to make an early diagnosis using the clinical records, physical examination, and laboratory tests, with an early resuscitation with volume, vasopressors, bicarbonate, and renal replacement therapy.Abstract
 <dis>Friedreich ataxia</dis> (<dis>FA</dis>) is an inherited autosomal recessive disease characterized by a neurological degenerative process of the cerebellum, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
<dis>FA</dis> is associated with <dis>ataxia</dis>, <dis>dysarthria</dis>, <dis>motor and sensory impairment</dis>, scoliosis, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes.
There is a significant risk of perioperative major complications during the anesthetic management of these patients.
We present the case of a fourteen-year-old patient with <dis>FA</dis>, who had a posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation underwent to total intravenous anesthesia.Abstract
 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy, and is characterized by frequent and difficult to treat seizures associated with <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
The case is presented of a 21 year-old male with Lennox- Gastaut syndrome, with bilateral cervical facet joint dislocation fracture at C6-C7 and spinal canal compression as a result of a fall during a seizure.
In this case the management of the difficult airway expected in an awake and uncooperative patient, with cervical spinal cord injury is described.
An airway management strategy was proposed, that allowed a rapid and safe airway control with the best possible tolerance and maintaining the neck immobilised, so as not to increase neurological injury.
Within this strategy, plan A was defined as inhalation induction with sevoflurane to maintain spontaneous breathing and tracheal intubation with Airtraq®.
We believe that the Airtraq® video laryngoscope with inhalational induction with sevoflurane is a valid and effective alternative in the management of expected difficult airway.Abstract
 Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a chromosomopathy associated to molecular mutations or microdeletions of chromosome 16.
It has an incidence of 1:125,000–700,000 live births.
RTS patients present craniofacial and thoracic anomalies that lead to a probable difficult-to-manage airway and ventilation.
They also present <dis>mental retardation</dis> and comorbidity, such as congenital cardiac defects, pulmonary structural anomalies and recurrent respiratory infections, which increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported after the use of certain drugs such as succinylcholine and atropine, in a higher incidence than in general population.
There is an increased risk of postoperative apnea–hypopnea in these patients.
We report the anesthetic management in a RTS patient undergoing emergent thoracic surgery due to oesophageal perforation and mediastinitis.
Lung isolation was achieved with a bronchial blocker guided with a fiberoptic bronchoscope and one-lung ventilation was performed successfully.Multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome is a group of complex disorders that include <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis>, chronic fatigue and/or respiratory problems. 
This syndrome could be triggered by specific allergens and toxins that cause neurophysiological sensitization and the appearance of the clinical symptomatology. 
Anaesthesia for these patients always poses a challenge for the anaesthetist, because they need to find and use drugs that do not trigger or aggravate the symptoms of the disease. 
Therefore, sevoflurane in these circumstances might be “the ideal anaesthetic”. 
Performing general anaesthesia with sevoflurane as the sole anaesthetic agent, together with a series of environmental measures formed the basis for successful anaesthesia and surgery in our patient with a multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome.
Amyloidosis is a term that involves a group of diseases characterised by deposition of extracellular monoclonal light-chain fibrillar immunoglobulin aggregates in the body, including many organs, with the larynx among them.

A case is presented of a 78 year-old man who was referred to our institution for strangulated umbilical hernia treatment. 
He suffered from progressive hoarseness and <dis>dysphagia</dis> for 5months. 
He had a history of primary laryngeal amyloidosis. 
Awake intubation was performed successful with the King Vision® video-laryngoscopy. 
Sedation was achieved using a remifentanil infusion and midazolam. 
Haemorrhagic lesions are caused by deposition of amyloid in and around vessels, resulting in increased vascular fragility. 
Therefore, anaesthetists should take care in intubating the tracheas of these patients.
Summary
Cranioencephalic traumatism is an important cause of morbidity-mortality between the infant and child population and a frequent cause of acquired disability in this population.
In small children, it generally occurs due to falls, being hit by a car or bicycle accidents and in adolescents due to traffic accidents.
The most common neurological complications are spacticity, <dis>ataxia</dis>, tremor and <dis>hemiparesis</dis>.
Speech disorders, principally in form of <dis>expression deficits</dis> and performance of verbal response, can be observed.
<dis>Neuropsychological disorders</dis> such as <dis>attention, memory and concentration deficits</dis> are frequent and <dis>behavior disorders</dis> such as apathy, lack of initiative, emotional lability, depression and aggresivity among others can be associated.
In general, there is good motor recovery, however neuropsychological deficits generally persist for a prolonged time.
The predictive factors of the functional results are related with the severity of the injury, age of the child and prelesional circumstances.
A rehabilitation program aimed at treating both the motor as well as neuropsychological sequels early should be established.
In this paper, we approach cranioencephalic traumatism in the child and adolescent globally, analyzing the sequels and their treatment, and giving special attention to the repercussion of them on growth, due to the typical characteristics of age.Summary
Recent genetic findings in the Rett syndrome make it necessary to up-date the present therapeutic resources and the methodology used in its rehabilitation.
General and specific objectives are explicitly established in the framework of a complete rehabilitation and the means to achieve them.
These female children present a mixed picture in which orthopedic problems (scoliosis, acquired luxation of the hip, equinus deformity, bone fractures), alterations in muscle tone, <dis>cognitive and speech problems</dis> stand out.
Besides reviewing the therapeutic treatment of the <dis>serious neurological and behavior problems</dis> such as <dis>ataxia</dis>, <dis>apraxia</dis>, stereotypal movements, phonetic and respiratory problem, crying episodes, <dis>problems of personal autonomy</dis>, <dis>senso-perceptive problems</dis>, <dis>cognitive alterations</dis> and <dis>behavior problems</dis>.
The clinical usefulness of different therapies is established: “muscular energy technique,” “reflex creeping and reflex rolling of the Vojta therapy,” “Bobath concept,” stimulation of balance and weight transfer, progressive and repeated patterns, splints, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, increasing and alternative communication, music therapy, etc.
The global objective is to establish an individualized program of teaching and therapy which, by maintaining the patients and their family in permanent contact and supervision with the specialized health care services of rehabilitation, improves the quality of life of these children and their families.
Summary
Cockayne syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by <dis>physical and psychomotor retardation</dis>, progressive neurological disfunction, photosensitivity, <dis>ophthalmological abnormalities</dis>, <dis>neurosensorial deafness</dis> and other pathologic features such as leucodistrophy and calcifications in the central nervous system with segmental demyelination in the peripheral nervous system.
In this work we report a clinical case of an eleven years old patient with Cockayne syndrome.
This patient presents a mixed picture with <dis>growth and psychomotor retardation</dis>, <dis>ataxia</dis>, muscle tone alterations, orthopedic problems, <dis>sensorial disfunctions</dis> and <dis>speech problems</dis>.
We describe the therapies used, including an individualized complete Rehabilitation program in order to improve the patient quality of life.
   Summary
Evaluation of <dis>psychic disability</dis> is made by the team psychologists who conduct this intervention in the subjects having <dis>mental retardation</dis> or <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
They consider the diagnosis and different grades of involvement in areas such as ability to carry out an autonomous life and to perform a work activity.   Summary
Introduction
Congenital myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant inherited generally transmitted multisystemic disease that is generally inherited through the mother.
It is characterized by the birth the newborn baby with hypotonia, respiratory and nutritional problems, and facial and general weakness.
Objective
Descriptive study of our experience in congenital myotonic dystrophy.
Patients and methods
Twelve patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy, belonging to 9 families in which the mother was a carrier of the disease have been studied.
The clinical, electromyographic and genetic characteristics of their families were analyzed.
Results
<dis>Motor retardation</dis> as well as the <dis>intellectual retardation</dis>, <dis>dysarthria</dis> and nasal voice was clear in all the patients.
The affected children had more than 1,500 repetitions of the cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) trinucleotide on chromosome 19 determined by the Southern Blot technique.
Myopathic type alterations were found in the electromyographs of all of the subjects.
The muscular biopsy done in 8 patients showed atrophy and predominance of type 1 fibers with central nuclei and type 2 fiber hypertrophy.
Conclusion
Myotonic dystrophy should be suspected in cases of newborn babies with hypotonia, in mothers with a background of abortions or stillborn babies.
After surviving the first years of life, their development is similar to the myotonic dystrophy of the adult.
It is fundamental to perform a genetic study in those who are affected by or carriers of the disease.Abstract
 The unilateral neglect syndrome is defined as the inability or difficulty to identify, refer, orient or respond to stimuli presented contralaterally to a brain injury in the <scp><neg>absence of</neg> <dis>elementary sensory or motor disorders</dis></scp>.
This syndrome is often associated with right parietal lesions, and the most frequent manifestations are <dis>attentional disturbances</dis>, <dis>perceptual deficits</dis> and <dis>somatosensorial disabilities</dis>.
We present the case of a 64-year old male suffering from an acute ischemic stroke affecting the complete territory of the right middle cerebral artery.
After the stroke, the patient had <dis>severe motor and functional deficits</dis>, associated with an <dis>intense attentional deficit</dis> in the context of a left unilateral neglect.
We carried out a longitudinal study using the Behavioral Inattentional Test to measure the clinical course during a one-year follow-up.
Our goal has been to show the sequence of clinical, cognitive and functional changes as well as the response of cases having similar severity to our case presented herein to specific rehabilitation programs.Abstract
 Introduction
The presence of <dis>dysphagia</dis> has been associated to dehydration, nutritional disorders, pneumonia and even death of the patient, this having an affect on the health care costs.
There are methods to detect <dis>dysphagia</dis> early based on evaluation of the clinical signs and methods that can be used at the bedside of the patient.
Objectives
To determine the utility of the evaluation of the clinical signs (CS) and the volume-viscosity test (V-VST) and evaluate their efficacy to detect risk of aspiration in the acute and subacute phase of stroke.
Patients and method
A retrospective evaluation of a cohort of 79 stroke patients was performed.
We compared the clinical signs and V-VST with the results observed with the videofluoroscopy (VFC).
The variables that determine accuracy and overall value of a diagnostic method, that is, sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative (NPP) predictive values, were calculated.
Results
A sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 28.8% was obtained for the Clinical Signs to detect severe dysphagia (Aspiration).
V-VST detected aspiration with 100% sensitivity and 13.6% specificity.
NPP was 62.5% and 100%, respectively.
Diagnostic accuracy was 0.38 for clinical signs and 0.48 for V-VST.
Conclusion
Using CS and V-VST for the evaluation of the <dis>dysphagic patient</dis> is a low-cost screening method that is easy to apply and highly sensitive.
The V-VST offers a higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and makes it possible to modify the diet early and to decide whether instrumental assessment is indicated.Abstract
 Objective
To determine quality of life (QoL) of adult patients with <dis>cerebral palsy</dis> (<dis>CP</dis>) during the ageing process and to analyze the effect of motor function, <dis>communication disorders</dis>, and <dis>intellectual disability</dis> (<dis>ID</dis>) on QoL.
Material and method
A cross-sectional study on adults with <dis>CP</dis> was performed.
A questionnaire to collect sociodemographic characteristics related to the disability, and two scales to assess the level of motor function Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and a scale to measure QoL (GENCAT Scale) were used.
Statistical analysis: T tests were performed to make a comparison with standard scores, and ANOVAS to analyze the incidence of motor function level, <dis>ID</dis>, and <dis>communication disorders</dis>.
Results
Participants were 46 patients (27 males, 19 females; age: M±SD, 50±7.9).
They presented low levels of QoL in interpersonal relations, self-determination, and social inclusion, and rights, and good levels of emotional well-being.
No significant effects were found for motor function level, but <dis>ID</dis> and <dis>communication disorders</dis> produced significant effects, and interactions with QoL dimensions were also significant.
Conclusions
QoL of adults with <dis>CP</dis> is satisfactory in emotional well-being and lower in self-determination and rights.
Degree of <dis>motor impairment</dis> has an impact on material and physical well-being; degree of <dis>ID</dis> affects personal development and self-determination; and <dis>communication problems</dis> influence diverse dimensions of QoL, although physical well-being to a lesser degree.Introduction
Stroke is the main cause of disability in adults and the second cause of mortality, being more common in elderly people. 
The aim of this study was to determine the functional outcome at 1 year in all patients older than 85 years who were evaluated by the Rehabilitation Therapy Service after being admitted for stroke in 2014.
Materials and methods
A longitudinal, observational, prospective study was conducted in 41 patients. 
We analysed sociodemographic information, the clinical characteristics of the strokes, neurological status at admission (NIHSS), functional status (Barthel Index and Rankin Scale) and walking capacity at admission, at rehabilitation discharge, and after one year.
All statistical test were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 19 for Windows and statistical significance was set at a p-value of 0.05.
Results
The mean age of the patients was 88.6 years (85-97) and 56% were women. 
The average NIHSS score in the first week was 11.2. 
The mean length of hospital stay was 15 days. 
The initial Barthel score was 80.6 and initial Rankin score was 1.51; these scores were 54.5 and 2.79, respectively, at 1 year after stroke. 
Eighteen patients (41.8%) died. 
The factors that significantly influenced functional recovery were a better previous functional status, NIHSS score <10, the absence of atrial fibrillation, having fewer comorbidities and the <scp><neg>absence of</neg> <dis>aphasia</dis></scp>.
Conclusions
One year after a stroke, elderly patients showed a high mortality rate, and those who survived had <dis>substantial functional loss</dis>.Abstract
 Rett Syndrome (RS) is a neurological disorder that almost exclusively affects females.
RS is characterized by <dis>severe mental retardation</dis> following a period of apparent normal development in early childhood.
The main clinical features include <dis>autism</dis>, spasticity, microcephaly, scoliosis, stereotyping, abnormal respiratory control and seizures.
Patients with RS have been reported to be extremely sensitive to sedatives and exhibit a slow recovery from anesthesia.
We describe and discuss the anesthetic management of a 26-year-old woman with RS and distal fracture of the humerus that underwent reduction and fixation with Kirschner'swires under regional anesthesia and sedation.
Intraoperatively, the patient experienced respiratory depression following the administration of 1 mg of I.V.
midazolam.
Our experience in this case led us to conclude and suggest that benzodiazepines should not be used in RS and in the absence of contraindications the technique of choice should be regional anesthesia.Abstract
 Fragile-X syndrome is an inherited form of <dis>mental retardation</dis> with a connective tissue component involving mitral valve prolapse.
The most frequent manifestations of fragile-X syndrome are <dis>learning disability</dis>, orofacial morphological alterations and macroorchidism.
The usefulness of advanced haemodynamic monitoring for goal-directed therapy is increasingly high during neurosurgical procedures.
Non-invasive cardiac output monitoring may be considered as a new alternative for emergency neurosurgical procedures.
Our aim was to detect hemodynamic changes in a syndromic fragile-X patient, given the usual concomitant presentation of cardiovascular disease, such as mitral valve prolapse and dilated aortic root, in an attempt at obtaining the best intraoperative and postoperative neurological outcomes without worsening cardiovascular function, by means of individualised intra-operative goal directed therapy.
This type of non-invasive monitoring allows surgery to proceed without delay and provides excellent information of the hemodynamic status.
This syndrome is relevant due to its anaesthetic implications and the paucity of cases published to date.Abstract
 Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hypotonia, obesity, short stature, <dis>mental retardation</dis>, hyperphagia, hypogonadism and low life expectancy.
We describe the case of a 31-year-old female patient with Prader-Willi syndrome scheduled for bariatric surgery.
Anesthetic considerations are reviewed highlighting perioperative complications associated with this syndrome.Introduction
Although involvement of the autonomic nervous system in the skin and gastrointestinal tract has been described in Sandhoff disease, no reports of autonomic changes of the cardiovascular system, such as <dis>dysautonomia</dis>, have been documented in the literature reviewed. 
On the other hand, the neurally mediated cardioinhibitory syncope that is refractory to medical management can be treated with pacemakers with closed loop sensors.
Materials and methods
The case is described of a 42 year-old patient who was diagnosed with Sandhoff disease. 
Associated to this condition, he presented with <dis>dysautonomia</dis> with daily episodes of syncope, with no response to medical treatment, which warranted the implant of a pacemaker with a closed loop sensor. 
The existing literature on this topic was subsequently reviewed.
Conclusions
Up until now, there have been no reports on the relationship between Sandhoff disease and <dis>dysautonomia</dis>. 
In the case of this patient, the deterioration in the quality of life was significant. 
The use of the closed loop stimulation (CLS) algorithm in neurally mediated cardioinhibitory syncope has been shown to reduce the number of syncopes in this type of patient and improve their quality of life.Objective
To obtain a clinical and socio-demographic profile of a group of elders of the community who participated in Memory Maintenance and Conservation activities.
Materials and methods
A series of 21 elders in whom cognoscitive status was determined applying the NEUROPSI Test and the presence of somatic symptoms, anxiety, <dis>social dysfunction</dis> and depression using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). 
Life satisfaction was assessed with the Satisfaction with Life Scale.
Results
Twenty-one elders, average age 73.5 years (SD: 7.3 years), range: 57-82, 90.5% female; 71.4% reported no current marital relationship, in 66.5% educational level ranged from 1 to 5 years, 42.9% assiduously attended the activities during the last 6 years, 76.2% <scp>had <neg>no</neg> <dis>cognoscitive impairment</dis></scp>, 90.5% no somatic symptoms, 90.5% no anxiety, 95.2% <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>social dysfunction</dis></scp>, 95.2% no depression and 76.1% reported being satisfied with their life.
Conclusions
<scp><neg>Absence of</neg> <dis>cognoscitive deterioration</dis></scp> is similar to that within the general population. 
Participants did not report depression, anxiety or somatic complaints, showed good social functioning and integration level and were satisfied with their life. 
Despite the limitations associated with small sample size, the results encourage us to continue this work and to engage in more rigorous research.Cogan's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disease typified by interstitial keratitis and Meniere-like auditory involvement, and it can be accompanied by systemic vasculitis. 
It's a rare disease and its diagnosis is difficult and often late, which increases the risk of sequelae, such as <dis>visual loss</dis> or <dis>deafness</dis>. 
In addition, its treatment is not well-established and is based on case reports that have observed efficacy of drugs such as cyclophosphamide, anti-TNF or tocilizumab. 
A case of Cogan's syndrome is presented that did not respond to methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or anti-TNF, but with a partial response to tocilizumab.Abstract
 Deep brain electrical stimulation of the ventro-medial globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease (PD) is an alternative in the treatment of rigidity in advanced cases which do not response to conventional pharmacological treatment.
Objective
To measure the clinical changes and collateral effects of bilateral electric stimulation of the ventro-medial globus pallidus, in a sample of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease with predominance of rigidity.
Methodology
An auto-control study of direct assignation was carried out, open to evaluate the changes according to the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) in a basal period, within 6 and 12 months of follow up same as the collateral effect and the medicament doses.
Results
12 patients were included (5 women) with ages of 62.4 ± 12.7 years (media ± DE), history of PD was14.2 ± 5.3 years, with Hoehn and Yahr stages within II and IV.
UPDRS III score in OFF- medication of 73 ± 11.3.
Beyond 6 months of follow up, a significant statistical change towards tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, posture and gait, can be appreciated (p < 0.05).
The best effect can be observed in the qualification of UPDRS III after implantation (35 to 38 delta points of the scale) and for stimulation particularly for bradykinesia (delta of 11 points).
There were no significant changes in levodopa doses.
The collateral effects such as phosphenes, contralateral paresthesias, deviation of labial commissure and <dis>dysarthria</dis>, were avoided with the adjustment of stimulation parameters during the surgery.
Conclusion
This study suggest that bilateral implantation of the ventro-medial globus pallidus is an efficient and safe method in patients PD with rigidity implanted in the Hospital Central Militar.Abstract
 Background
The tympanic membrane perforation is generally caused by infection or trauma.
It is a condition that can cause <dis>hearing loss</dis>; its incidence varies between 1 and 3% of the population in the United States, and even less than 1% in the world population.
Objective
This study is to conduct a pilot test in which the effectiveness of conservative treatment was measured and compared by applying phenytoin or platelet-rich plasma to close tympanic perforations and the healing period of the same.
Patients and methods
Ten patients were included and all of them fulfilled the selection criteria: Age over five years-old, indiscriminate sex with a diagnosis of perforated eardrum, eardrum perforation between 30 and 60% and presence of tympanic remnant; and no previous surgical treatment.
Elimination criteria were those patients with marginal eardrum perforations, patients who were not on antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, poor response to platelet-rich plasma after 6 weeks, patients with known autoimmune, active neoplastic, atopic otic conditions and those currently under immunosuppressive treatments.
Participants were randomized into two groups according to treatment: phenytoin (0.2 mg) or platelet-rich plasma (0.2–0.5 cc).
Results
Ten patients with unilateral tympanic perforation were recorded whose average age was 26.9 ± 14.9 years; the sex distribution was 1.5:1 male predominance.
In treatment A, the average closing time was 3.8 ± 0.836 weeks; meanwhile, in the treatment B the closure time was 5.2 ± 0.836 weeks.Abstract
 Background
<dis>Sensorineural hearing loss</dis> (<dis>SNHL</dis>) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease.
In some populations, c.365delG mutation in the _GJB2_ gene represents the most frequent cause of <dis>hereditary SNHL</dis>.
The great diversity of mutations in the _GJB2_ gene worldwide highlights the participation of ethnic background in <dis>SNHL</dis>.
Objective
To describe the presence of homozygous c.del35G mutation in the _GJB2_ gene in a Mexican family with <dis>SNHL</dis>.
Materials and methods
A Mexican family with <dis>SNHL</dis> was included in the study.
Analysis of the _GJB2_ gene was performed through whole exome sequencing (WES) and DNA direct sequencing analysis in all members of the family and in 100 normal controls.
Results
Affected sibs showed the homozygous c.del35G mutation in the _GJB2_ gene.
Parents of the families were heterozygous for the molecular defect and had normal audition.
Conclusion
We describe a homozygous c.del35G mutation in the _GJB2_ gene through WES analysis, a homozygous mutation with a very low occurrence in Mexican population.Introduction
Based on the levels of <dis>visual disability</dis> reported by World Health Organization, has been prepared the National Campaign for Amblyopia and Strabismus in Mexico, with the Mexican Center of Strabismus, the Mexican Society of Ophthalmology, and the Mexican Council of Ophthalmology, with the objective of establishing a screening program in amblyopia in the general population.
Method
A public screening program was designed in 4 phases, from the program and organization of sites, a preparatory course, to the analysis of results, from May 2016 to January 2017.
Results
Ninety sites were organized in Mexico, 1,028 people were studied, aged 17.4±19 years, 727 were children aged 6.7±3 years. 
Several alerts were obtained that demonstrate the problematic and the requirements of public health.
Conclusions
The high levels of <dis>visual disability</dis> in the world population requires better strategies, as demonstrated by the National Campaign for Amblyopia in Mexico. 
It has to be considered a permanent information to the public, facilitating access to the first-level medical service; promoting early care of vulnerable groups; medical actualization; communication with health leaders that generates cost-effective strategies for early detection and treatment, controlled by laws that results in the reduction of <dis>visual disability</dis>. 
Fourteen Iberomerican countries joined the campaign because finally the causes of amblyopia are the same, the lack of information is repeated, and the numbers of disability increase.Introduction
Retinophaty of prematurity (ROP) is a disease in which abnormal neovascularization develops in the retina and could be a cause of <dis>blindness</dis>.
Objective
To determine severe ROP prevalence.
Material and methods
In this retrospective, observational, descriptive, transverse study, we did a review of the clinical records of premature patients with < 34 weeks of gestation and a birth weight  1,750g if they have risk factors for ROP. 
From 2005 to 2014, all the newborns were examined by a retinologist. 
ROP prevalence per year was determined, only the prevalence for severe ROP was compared because it requires treatment and has a high risk for <dis>blidness</dis>.
Results
One hundred forty-three newborns were included, 29 (20.2%) had severe ROP. 
When comparing for years there was a peak during 2005, with a descend in the prevalence of severe ROP in 2014, so in ten years there was a downward trend.
Conclusions
Severe ROP cumulated prevalence was 20.2%, similar to that observed in other latinoamerican countries. 
The high prevalence observed from 2005 to 2009, is explained because we examined patients refered from other institutions without screening programs for ROP. 
In 2010 we observed a descend in the prevalence, because only patient from our institution were included. 
From 2011 to 2014 we report <scp><neg>none</neg> <dis>blind</dis> children with ROP</scp>.Introduction.
The use of steroids in the post-natal period is a common practice, although it is still controversial in neonatology due to its association with adverse effects and risk of neurodevelopment sequelae.

Material and methods.
A retrospective, observational, analytical study was conducted including patients weighing less than 1500g that received a steroid protocol for extubation between 2008 and 2010 and compared with a control group. 
Neurodevelopment was evaluated using the Bayley II scale at one and two years of age, as well as an analysis of the demographic variables and morbidity.

Results.
A total of 132 patients were included, with 46 in the study group and 86 in the control group. 
No differences were found in the demographic variables, although the length of stay was significantly longer in the study group. 
An increased risk for arterial hypertension, grade II intraventricular haemorrhage, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy was found in the study group. 
There was no difference as regards <dis>blindness</dis>, <dis>hearing loss</dis>, <dis>cerebral palsy</dis>, and leukomalacia. 
At 2 years of age an increase in the risk for <dis>mild mental development impairment</dis> was found in the control group and increased risk for <dis>significant delay in psychomotor development</dis> in the study group.

Conclusions.
Post-natal low dose steroids are effective to accomplish extubation in patients that are ventilation dependent. 
Significant psychomotor development changes were found at 2 years of age, <scp>with <neg>no evidence of</neg> leukomalacia or <dis>cerebral palsy</dis></scp>.
Abstract
 This article describes a study conducted in an Andalusia Community school (year 2010-2011).
It studied the influence of cochlear implantation on improving the quality of life of the children who received implants during their early years.
The methodological design and results of the study are also presented, in order to find a better solution to improve the life conditions and personal development of children suffering <dis>hearing loss</dis>, and having a cochlear implant.Chronic alcoholism causes toxicity in the central and peripheral nervous system, Marchiafava-Bignami disease being one of its less frequent complications.
This entity is characterized by demyelinization of the callous body.
The clinical picture is varied, the most frequent symptoms being: <dis>dementia</dis>, <dis>attention disorders</dis>, <dis>gait difficulty</dis> and interhemispheric deconnection syndrome.
Neuroimaging techniques, basically magnetic resonance imaging, are required for its diagnosis.
We present the case of a patient who was admitted to the intensive care unit due to neurological deterioration and respiratory arrest.
He was finally diagnosed as having Marchiafava-Bignami disease.
We explain the diagnostic difficulties and therapeutic alternatives of this disease.Abstract
 Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is characterized by a spectrum of central nervous system anomalies arising from a failure in the differentiation and division of the prosencephalon.
Approximately 50% of the causes are chromosomal, the most frequent being trisomies 13 and 18.
A familial form has occasionally been described.
There are three types of HPE: alobar, semilobar and lobar.
We present the case of a 33-year-old woman who showed identical ultrasonographic findings compatible with semilobar HPE in the second trimester of two successive pregnancies.
Both parents had normal karyotypes, but <dis>mild mental retardation</dis>.
Both pregnancies were finalized by dilation and extraction abortion in weeks 21 and 20, respectively.
Histopathological analysis confirmed HPE in both fetuses.
Given these findings, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed in both parents to exclude familial HPE.
The mother showed slight asymmetry in ventricular size and fornix with no other abnormalities.
Study of the father confirmed our suspicions and showed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum in the medial and posterior portions, as well as a defect in the morphology of the lateral ventricles and a single pericallosal artery.
The cerebral sickle showed little development.Aims
1\.
To facilitate the making of advanced dispositions to residents with present psychic autonomy.
2.
To know their opinions regarding legal and organizational issues, and to explain different options.
Methods
In November 2000 several informative meetings were held for 41 residents of our center’s Nursing Home who were selected as they <scp>presented <neg>no</neg> potentially fatal disease or <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
20 of them accepted to participate in the study during the first term 2001 and an individual interview was carried out.
The protocol included epidemiological date, scores on several scales as well as medical care, organizational data.
The summary was signed by the resident, the social worker, geriatrician and representative chosen.
Results
20 participants: 30% single, 45% widowers.
80% are able to read and write or had primary studies.
Barthel index score 73, Mini Mental de Lobo: 25, Philadelphia Escale: 7,7.
Will made: 35%.
Family support in 60%.
70% elected a family member as representative.
Calls and visits restrictions in 10%.
85% requested catholic religious assistance.
80% had some manifest outcome arrangement.
The greatest fear is pain (35%) and <dis>functional impairment</dis> (20%), 75% would want information and palliative care in case of terminal disease (oncologic or degenerative illness), 65% agreed with CPR maneuvers.
85% do not want artificial nutrition in case of <dis>dementia</dis>.
5% want to be corneal donors, and 35% want to be one after the speech.
Conclusions
1\.
The accomplishment of previous arrangements offers to residents the possibility to discuss important aspects with the medical attention team.
It could help us in the management of residents in case they lose their ability to make decisions.
In general, residents want to receive more information and reject artificial nutrition despite the current medical attitudes.Abstract
 Objective
to determine the clinical, functional and mental characteristics of nonagenarians admitted to a medium-stay geriatric unit for hospital-based rehabilitation and to review outcomes at dischargeand 1 year later.
Patients and method
we performed a longitudinal observational study of nonagenarians consecutively hospitalised in a medium-stay geriatric unit over a 16-month period.
On admission, the variables collected were diagnoses, functional and cognitive status, household composition, comorbidity, and serum albumin.
The global and relative functional gain and rate of institutionalization at discharge were also evaluated.
After 12 months, the patients were telephoned to establish mortality, functional status, and new admissions.
Results
the mean age of the 51 patients studied was 92.06 (SD 2.42) years and 75% were women.
The mean functional gain at discharge was 23.27 (SD 14.06) in the Barthel Index (BI), with a relative functional gain of 45.4% from impairment at admission.
At 1 year 31% of the patients were alive and living at home and showed a functional gain of ≥ 20 in the BI from admission.
These outcomes increased to 59% in patients with better functional status before admission (previous BI ≥ 80) and <scp><neg>absence of</neg> <dis>severe functional and cognitive impairment</dis> at admission</scp> (BI < 20 and Pfeiffer ≥ 5 at admission, respectively).
Conclusions
nonagenarians with recent onset of <dis>functional impairment</dis> also benefit from rehabilitation in a medium-stay geriatric unit; those with better functional and cognitive status can achieve results similar to those in younger patients.The concept of frailty is currently being debated in the field of geriatric care, but there is no agreed definition that would allow frail elderly persons to be identified.
The purpose of this article was to identify and group the opinions of clinical experts in our setting.
We conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with health professionals (clinicians and nurses) working mainly with the elderly in several health care settings in districts 2 and 5 of the autonomous region of Madrid.
The responses obtained indicated five distinct trends: a reduction in physiologic reserve, <dis>loss of functional autonomy</dis>, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, the presence of chronic diseases, and a minority view that rejects this concept.
Notable was the view of frailty as a multifactorial phenomenon in which different weight was given to biological, psychological or social factors according to the type of health professional consulted.
The conceptual diversity of the term «frailty» hampers comparison among different studies.
Therefore, a working definition of the term, accepted by health professionals involved in the care of the elderly, should be established.Abstract
 Objective
To determine the characteristics of elderly persons hospitalized for congestive heart failure and identify the factors associated with <dis>functional impairment</dis> or death at discharge and 3 months later.
Material and methods
We performed a prospective observational study that included 162 patients admitted to an Acute Geriatric Care Unit with a diagnosis of heart failure from February to July 2007.
Socio-demographic, clinical, functional and cognitive factors were recorded during admission.
Functional and vital measurements were reported at discharge and 3 months later.
Results
The incidence of mortality or <dis>functional decline</dis> was 48.8% at discharge and was 37.3% 3 months later.
In the final model, predictors of <dis>functional impairment</dis> or mortality at discharge were days of hospital stay and a worse Pfeiffer test score (odds ratio [OR]: 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33–2.29).
Three months after discharge, independent prognostic factors were age (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02–1.17), hyponatremia (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77–0.94), length of QRS in milliseconds (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97–0.99), absence of ventricular hypertrophy (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.19–0.94), and a poor result in the Pfeiffer Test (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.13–1.73).
Conclusions
Cognitive evaluation during hospital admission for heart failure in the elderly helps to select individuals at risk of <dis>functional impairment</dis> or death at discharge and 3 months later.Objective
to analyze the prevalence of depressive syndrome and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in elderly non-institutionalized women in Cali (Colombia).
Material and methods
we performed a cross-sectional descriptive study.
The Yesavage depression scale (15-item version) and the Pfeiffer test were applied.
A total of 416 women over the age of 60 years old living in the city of Cali and attending distinct health centres were chosen during the first semester of 2004, using non-probabilistic sampling.
The association of sociodemographic and clinical variables with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was evaluated using a logistic regression model.
Results
the prevalence of depression was 19.95% (95% CI, 15.99-23.91%) and that of <dis>cognitive deterioration</dis> was 2.64% (95% CI, 0.98-4.31%).
No predictive factors were found in the multivariate analysis, although a higher risk of <dis>cognitive deterioration</dis> was observed in women with depression (OR = 3.171; 95% CI, 0.833-12.081%).
Among the oldest women (OR = 5.979; 95% CI, 0.990-36.131%), higher income seemed to be a protective factor (OR = 0.160; 95% CI, 0.018-1.446%).
Conclusions
a moderate prevalence of depressive symptomatology and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was found in non-institutionalized elderly women.
The prevalence of these disorders should be determined in each health centre.
This would enable intervention programs aimed at improving quality of life in these women to be designed and would help to reduce the factors causing depression and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.Objective
to detect the percentage of patients with <dis>dementia</dis> admitted to a psychogeriatric department, who have a high risk of falls, and to evaluate acceptance and compliance with hip protectors during their stay in hospital and 2 weeks and 3 months after discharge.
Material and methods
we performed a hospital-based prospective cohort study.
Risk of falling was evaluated on the basis of immediate bipedal standing instability or abnormal semi-tandem posture, a get-up-and-go test time of more than 20 seconds, or clinical judgement.
Compliance during hospital stay was evaluated through nursing records and compliance outside hospital by telephone interviews at 15 days and 3 months after discharge.
Results
a total of 115 patients consecutively admitted to the psychogeriatric department of the Santa Creu Hospital in Vic were assessed.
Sixty patients (52.2%) were excluded from the study, the main reason being dependence on another person for walking.
Of the 55 patients included, 44 (80.0%) had a high risk of falls and were candidates for hip protectors.
In-hospital compliance was 80.5% (95% CI: 65.1-91.2).
The most common cause of non-compliance was removal of the hip protector by the patient.
Compliance after discharge was 64.5% (95% CI: 45.4-80.8) at 2 weeks and 57.1% (95% CI: 28.9-82.4) at 3 months.
Conclusions
a high risk of falling was found in a large percentage of patients with <dis>dementia</dis> who were <scp><neg>not</neg> <dis>dependent on others for walking</dis></scp>.
Compliance was not a problem in the use of hip protectors in a high-risk population in the hospital-admission setting but was weaker in the community setting.Abstract
 The elderly population is currently increasing.
In this population there is a high incidence of <dis>cognitive decline</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis>, which has a negative influence on personal life and family functioning, as well as economic and healthcare repercussions.
The present article aims to indicate possible predictors of <dis>cognitive decline</dis> with a view to predicting this situation and intervening before the <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> is unavoidable.
Some predictors of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> could be the following: age, sex, education, a family history of <dis>dementia</dis>, objective and subjective difficulties with memory, several medical problems (hypertension and diabetes), <dis>sensory- motor difficulties</dis>, hypometabolism in some cerebral areas, reduced hippocampal size, carrying one or two apolipoprotein e4 alleles, a low score in cognitive tasks (especially immediate and delayed recall), deficits in associative learning and naming, low cognitive plasticity, depression, a low literacy level, poor general cognitive functioning, low participation in social activities, low physical activity, lack of social support, the use of medication and, finally, sleep-related problems.
All of these factors could be important in predicting <dis>cognitive decline</dis> in very old age.Abstract
 Introduction
This study analyzed the effectiveness of an individual, delimited, semi- structured reminiscence program as an intervention strategy to reduce depressive symptomatology in a population of Portuguese old people.
Material and methods
A semi-structured reminiscence program was developed in 5 individual sessions.
The program's impact on depressive symptomatology was tested in 90 subjects aged over 65 years with depressive symptoms, no antidepressive medication, and <scp><neg>no</neg> signs of <dis>dementia</dis></scp>.
In a randomized experimental design, participants were assigned to one of 3 groups: _a)_ experimental group (exposed to the program); _b)_ control group, or _c)_ placebo-control group (with weekly relaxation sessions).
Pre and post-test score differences in Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (adapted by Gonçalves and Fagulha, 2000-2001, from the original developed by Radloff, 1977), were analyzed in all participants at the same time intervals.
Results
In the experimental group, significant improvements were found in depressive symptomatology (t [29]=19.70, _p_ <0.01); the mean values decreased from 39.87 (standard deviation [SD]=7.90) to 13.60 (SD=5.14).
In the control group, a significant increase in depressive symptomatology was observed (z=−2.83; _p_ <0.001); the mean values rose from 30.93 (SD=7.07) to 34.10 (SD=8.76).
In the placebo-control group, depressive symptomatology was reduced (t [29]=2,52; _p_ <0.05) from 33.967 (SD=7.37) to 30.57 (SD=9.94), although the difference was less significant than that observed in the experimental group.
Conclusions
The results suggest that elaboration of positive and negative autobiographical memories, stimulation of instrumental and integrative reminiscences and narration of specific and positive autobiographical memories using the reminiscence program, as designed and analyzed in this study, may be a tool for psychological intervention to reduce depressive symptomatology in old age.Abstract
 Introduction
A major challenge for gerontological research is to differentiate adequately between old adults with poor performance on cognitive tasks due to depression, and those who present <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> associated with <dis>dementia</dis>.
In view of the fact that cognitive plasticity has already proved to be efficient in the diagnosis of age-associated cognitive impairment, <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> and <dis>dementia</dis>, the objective of this study is to investigate the possibility that it may also prove useful in the differential diagnosis of these two disorders.
Materials and methods
A total of 50 old adults participated in the study.
These completed the Positions Test (PT) and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test of Learning Potential (AVLT-LP) as measures of cognitive plasticity.
Participants also undertook the Spanish version of Mini Mental State (MEC), Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LSQ) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
Socio-demographic data were also collected.
Results
With regard to cognitive plasticity, depressed old adults do not differ from those without depression.
On the other hand, old adults with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> present less cognitive plasticity than those without <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Conclusion
Cognitive plasticity appears to be a relevant variable in the differentiation between old people with low cognitive performance due to depression and old people with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.Abstract
 Objective
To determine prevalence and clinical characteristics of elderly diabetic patients in nursing homes.
Material and method
Observational and multicentre study in 14 nursing homes in Cádiz (Spain).
Study variables: age, sex, prevalence of diabetes, duration of diabetes, complications, macrovascular complications, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.
Metabolic control: frequency of baseline blood glucose and HbA1c determinations.
Metabolic complications suffered.
Treatment: oral and type of antidiabetics, insulinisation.
Diabetes education.
Functional and mental assessment using Barthel index and MMT.
Data was analysed using SPSS v17.0.
Results
A total of 1952 elderly institutionalised patients were studied, with a diabetes prevalence of 26.44%.
The study included 312 patients with a mean age of 79.7 years, of whom 57.4% were women, and 66.9% knew of their diagnosis of diabetes for over 10 years.
Vascular events were suffered by 55.1%, with the most common being ischaemic stroke (55.2%), followed by myocardial infarction (18%) and 14.5% with peripheral arterial disease.
There were 29.6% with retinopathy, 21.3% diabetic nephropathy, and 25.6% suffering from distal symmetric polyneuropathy.
HbA1c analysis was performed in 90.1% of patients, with 50% levels between 7 and 9%, with a six-monthly assessment rate of 63.4%.
Metabolic complications: diabetic ketoacidosis 7.1%, hyperosmolar syndrome 2.9%, and 15.7% symptomatic hypoglycaemia.
Oral hypoglycaemic agents were being taken by 66% of patients, with the most frequently used being metformin (55.3%) followed by gliclazide and repaglinide (10.2%, 3.4%, respectively).
50.2% were insulinised.
45.6% <dis>functional dependence</dis>.
Barthel Index average of 48.4 points, with 46.1% diagnosed with <dis>dementia</dis>, moderate state, 36.7%.
Conclusions
Diabetic prevalence in nursing homes is high, and institutionalised patients are elderly, long-standing diabetics, with both macro- and microvascular complications, and have a <dis>significant level of mental and functional disabilities</dis>.Abstract
 Aim
To analyse the differences between men and women as regards the prevalence of the frailty syndrome, its association with different sociodemographic and bio- psychosocial health factors, and its impact on the level of dependence of institutionalised elderly men and women <scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>severe cognitive decline</dis></scp>.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive and multicenter study was conducted in 16 nursing homes in Cuenca (Spain).
A representative sample of 281 elderly who fulfilled the inclusion criteria was randomly selected.
Measures: frailty following Fried's criteria, age, gender, morbidity, geriatric syndromes, level of dependence, cognitive status, mood and quality of life.
Results
The overall prevalence of frailty was 53.7% (60% among women).
The following criteria were associated with frailty: age, respiratory diseases, arthritis, diabetes, sensory deficits, urinary and faecal incontinences, polypharmacy, hospitalization in the past year, <dis>functional impairment</dis>, <dis>cognitive decline</dis> and depressive symptoms.
The states of frailty were independently associated with dependence (OR=5.1), more strongly in men (OR=7.3) than in women (OR=3.6).
Clinical criteria of frailty that best predicted dependence were: exhaustion in women (OR=4.7) and low physical activity in men (OR=12.3).
Conclusions
The prevalence of frailty found among the institutionalised elderly population was greater than that expected for a general population.
Older frail adults had poorer biological and psychosocial health results, suggesting that the physical decline is accompanied by an identity crisis.
Frailty expresses differently in men and women.
Women have a higher prevalence, but its impact on their dependence is less than men.Abstract
 Introduction
The Model of Person Centered Care has attracted increasing interest for use in gerontology centers.
Therefore, the contributions about its impact are scarce in our context.
The objective of this paper is to establish the impact that the interventions associated with the Model of Person Centered Care in the «Etxean Ondo» Project have on the quality of life of residents with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Material and methods
One hundred and ninetten residents with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> were selected: 59 in the control group and 60 in the experimental group.
Subjects in each group were sorted by <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>: mild or severe.
Changes were implemented in the physical and organizational environments for the promotion of autonomy and wellbeing.
Quality of life was assessed before and 6 months after intervention using the Fumat Scales (<dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>) and Qualid (<dis>severe cognitive impairment</dis>).
The t-Student test was used for comparison of means.
Results
In intergroup comparisons, significant differences in the Fumat Scale for the control group with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> were initially identified.
These differences were not recorded in the post assessment.
The experimental group with <dis>severe cognitive impairment</dis> was significantly improved in the Qualid Scale post assessment.
In intragroup comparisons, significant improvements were evident in the quality of life of experimental subjects, both with <dis>severe cognitive impairment</dis> (Qualid) and mild (Fumat).
Conclusions
The findings support the effectiveness of the interventions and identify methodological and conceptual issues that have been considered to analyze the Model of Person Centered Care efects.Abstract
 Introduction
The purpose of this study is to determine the opinion of professionals working in residential aged care facilities on the regulation of sexuality in these settings.
Materials and methods
Fifty-three professionals from five residential aged care facilities located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona answered several questions regarding the advisability of establishing measures for the regulation of sexuality in RACFs, the elements that could contribute to this, and the aspects that such regulations should consider.
Results
Around 50% of the participants recognized the advisability of having some type of measures for sexuality regulation in residential aged care facilities.
According to their responses this should be developed taking into account professional opinions, but also the points of view of the residents and their relatives.
The most frequently mentioned regulations were those that ensured that any kind of sexually charged situation occurred in a private environment.
The development of strategies are suggested to distinguish those people with <dis>dementia</dis> that are competent to consent to sexual acts from those who are not.
Conclusions
The opinion of professionals working in RACFs regarding the advisability of establishing measures for sexuality regulation seems to be considerably divided.
Thus, whilst around 50% of them recognize their potential usefulness, the other half consider them unnecessary or even counterproductive for the sexual freedom of residents.
Associating regulation with prohibition and sexuality with sexual activity was not uncommon among the responses of the participants.Abstract
 Pain is a prevalent symptom in cancer geriatric patients, appearing in up to 90% of patients with terminal cancer.
This requires a multidimensional approach, as there is a high percentage of inappropriate assessments and treatments.
Unrecognized or poorly treated pain in the geriatric population, especially in cancer patients, leads to the development of disabling symptoms such as depression, anxiety, isolation, <dis>sleep disturbances</dis>, and appetite, and very especially, <dis>loss of functional capacity and quality of life</dis>.
In this review an analysis is made on the most relevant studies on the diagnosis and management of cancer pain in the geriatric population.Abstract
 Objective
To analyse the relationship between the primary diagnosis on admission to an Acute Geriatric Unit (AGU) and the risk of hospital mortality and one year after discharge
Material and methods
A longitudinal study was conducted on patients admitted to the Central Hospital AGU Red Cross in Madrid in 2009.
The admission diagnosis was grouped by Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs).
The date of death was collected from the medical charts and the National Death Index Ministry of Health report.
The main outcome of study was the association between diagnoses on admission and <dis>functional impairment</dis> at discharge (measured as a loss of 10 or more points between the Barthel Index at discharge and that on admission), mortality during hospitalization, at 3 months and one year after discharge.
The multivariate analysis was adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, functional and cognitive status, and serum albumin.
Results
The study included1147 patients, with a mean age of 86.7 years (SD ± 6.7), and 66% were women.
During admission, 10.1% of patients died and 36.6% had <dis>functional impairment</dis> at discharge.
After discharge, 25.5% died at 3 months, and 42.2% at one year.
The distribution of the primary diagnoses at admission (between parentheses hospital mortality and at year) were heart failure, 21.4% (8.1% and 37.4%), pneumonia,13.3% (12.3% and 46.4%), and aspiration pneumonia, 4.7% (27.5%, y 71%), respiratory diseases,13.3% (6.6% and 38.2%), urinary infection,10.2% (5.1% and 42.7%), and stroke (excluding AIT), 9.9% (13.3% and 46.9%).
In the multivariate analysis, only admissions due to aspiration pneumonia were independently associated with increased risk of hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI = 1.13 to 44.42), and stroke with increased risk of <dis>functional impairment</dis> at discharge (odds ratio, 6.01; 95% CI = 3.42-10.57).
No diagnosis was independently associated with increased risk of death at 3 months and at year
Conclusions
Admission from aspiration pneumonia carries an increased risk of death in elderly patients hospitalised for acute medical conditions.
After discharge, the risk of death must be attributed to factors other than the admission diagnosis
Abstract
 Background
Ageing has been linked to a high prevalence of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, which, in turn, has been related to balance disturbances and <dis>gait disorders</dis>.
The aim of this study was to identify whether there are differences between subjects with and without <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> regarding the quality of gait and balance.
Material and methods
An observational study was conducted on institutionalised people older than 65 years (n = 82).
Gait and balance was evaluated after the assessment of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
Single and dual tests were used including, the 6-minute walking, stride length, and gait speed.
Timed Up and Go tests were also used to evaluate balance.
Results
The participants were divided into three groups: 28 subjects in the group <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp> (MMSE ≥ 27), 29 subjects with mild (27 < MMSE ≤ 21) and 26 subjects with <dis>moderate cognitive impairment</dis> (MMSE < 21).
Gait assessment showed significant between-groups differences in all the variables ( _P_ < .05).
The variables assessing balance also showed significantly worse values in those groups with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Conclusion
The severity of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> is related to <dis>impaired balance and gait</dis>, thus the clinical monitoring of these variables in population at risk is needed.Abstract
 Background
The prevalence of lung obstruction increases with age and the presence of comorbidities.
Although a complete spirometry is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, this may be impractical in elderly patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> or <dis>functional dependence</dis>.
Recently, the use of portable devices using the FEV1/FEV6 ratio have shown to be useful for assessing the presence of lung obstruction, with greater ease of use, but its usefulness has not been established in the elderly population with multiple morbidities.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients hospitalised in the complex chronic patients Unit of the University Hospital Mútua de Terrassa.
All of them completed a questionnaire that included –among other things– measurements of <dis>functional dependence</dis> and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Three manoeuvres validated with the Piko-6 device were attempted before discharge, and considering an FEV1/FEV6 < 0.75 as criteria for obstruction.
An analysis was performed on the characteristics of the population that was able to perform the tests, as well as the prevalence of pulmonary obstruction.
Results
A total of 54 patients were included in the study, of which 35 (64.81%) performed the manoeuvres correctly.
Patients who were unable to complete the manoeuvres of the Piko-6 had more <dis>functional dependence</dis> (Barthel 19 vs. 72, _P_ < .0001) and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (Pfeiffer 1 vs. 9, _P_ < .0001; MEC 28/35 vs. 3/35, _P_ < .010).
The prevalence of obstruction was 71.43%, with an underdiagnosis of 72%.
Conclusions
The FEV1/FEV6 ratio was not determined in 35.18% of the patients due to <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> or <dis>functional dependence</dis>.
The prevalence of obstruction and underdiagnosis exceeded 70%.Objectives
The Hospital Clínico San Carlos Committee against violence established a protocol in 2012 in order to detect and follow-up violence against elderly persons. 
This article presents the experience after 3years of its introduction, as well as an analysis comparing the differences between those younger and older than 65years of age.
Material and methods
All cases were collected during years 2013, 2014, and 2015, and were divided into two groups, A and B, according to age, younger or older than 65years. 
Parameters studied were: gender, place of detection (emergency department, during hospital admission, or outpatient clinics), type of professional worker who detected each case (social workers, nurses, or physicians), previous history of violence, type of aggression (physical, psychological, financial), institutional procedures once aggression was confirmed, and deaths after one year of follow-up. 
The SPPS v.18.0 package was used for the statistical analysis.
Results
A total of 172 cases were detected, of which 140 of them were included in groupA (65 years, 22.8%). 
Gender: GroupA: women: 93.5%. 
GroupB: women: 78.1% (P=.014). 
Registration site: GroupA: emergency department: 90.7%, hospital wards: 6.4%, outpatient wards: 3.0. 
GroupB: emergency department: 65.6%, hospital wards: 31.6%, outpatient wards: 2.8% (P=.001). 
Notification: GroupA: social worker: 25%, physician: 67.8%, nurse: 6.4%. 
GroupB: social worker: 65.2%, physician: 28.1%, nurse: 6.2% (P<.001). 
Previous violence history: GroupA: 62.1%.

More than one-third of patients in groupB, and none of the patients in groupA, died in the year of follow-up.
Conclusions
There are more problems detected in the Emergency Department. 
There is a history of previous violence in more than half of the cases in both age groups. 
The profile of the victim is an elderly woman with <dis>significant physical and cognitive impairment</dis>. 
Economic abuse and neglect are more frequent in the elderly population. 
In our series, more than one-third of elderly patients who are victims of ill-treatment die each year. 
The hospital registry is fundamental for the detection and follow-up of abuse in the elderly.Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of <dis>dementia</dis> in the elderly population. 
Currently, there are no effective treatments to prevent or delay the natural course of the disease. 
Numerous studies have provided information about the molecular processes underlying biological ageing and, perhaps more importantly, potential interventions to slow ageing and promote healthy longevity in laboratory model systems. 
The main issue addressed in this review is whether an intervention that has anti-ageing properties can alter the appearance and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease, a disease in which age is the biggest risk factor. 
Different anti-ageing interventions have been shown to prevent (and in some cases possibly restore) several parameters recognised as central symptoms to the development of Alzheimer's disease. 
In addition, they are taking the first steps towards translating these laboratory discoveries into clinical applications.Abstract
 Introduction
The Edmonton Frailty Scale was developed in Alberta (Canada).
It has been applied in different scenarios, such as acute units, day hospitals, and outpatient care.
There are no studies published describing the usefulness of this scale in Colombia.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study and secondary diagnostic test analysis was designed with the objective of studying the criterion validity of the Edmonton Frail Scale using Fried's frailty criteria as standard.
Patients 60 years old and over from the community were included.
Patients with <dis>severe dementia</dis>, <dis>limited mobility</dis>, and unable to perform the tests were excluded.
Results
The study included 101 patients from the community in Floridablanca, Colombia.
The mean age was 68.9 years, and 74% were women.
The median walking speed was 1.1 m/sec.
According to the Fried's criteria, 46% were vigorous elderly, and the prevalence of frailty was 7.9%.
Using the EFS, 78% were vigorous elderly, with a prevalence of frailty of 8.9%.
Taking 6 or more points as a cut-off, the sensitivity of this scale was 75% and had a specificity of 88%.
Conclusions
A similar frequency of frailty was found on applying the two measurement scales.
It is important to highlight the multidimensional view of the Edmonton scale, complementing the data of the most physical and sarcopenia-centred phenotype of Fried's criteria.Loneliness is a problem that affects a very high percentage of older people, and can lead to <dis>physical and/or mental illness</dis>. 
This article aims to present a systematic review of programs to combat loneliness directed towards the institutionalised elderly. 
Experimental and quasi-experimental articles published between 2000 and 2016 were included in the review. 
An analysis was carried out on the quality of the methodological evidence of each of the articles. 
The programs analysed included animal-assisted, contacts with families through videoconferencing, gardening and/or horticulture workshops, reminiscence therapies, humour therapies, and cognitive interventions. 
The results show that intervention programs are effective to reduce the feeling of loneliness. 
The methodological limitations of the studies are discussed and future research is recommended.
Introduction
The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> on <dis>functional decline</dis> in hospitalised patients aged ≥60 years.
Methods
Measurements at admission included demographic data, Charlson's comorbidity index, and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (according to education level).
Data were also collected on hospital length of stay, depression, and delirium developed during hospitalisation. 
The outcome, Barthel Index (BI), was measured at admission, discharge, and 1-month post-discharge. 
Patients with BI≤75 at admission (n=54) or with a missing BI value were excluded (n=1). 
Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore predictive factors with <dis>functional decline</dis> (BI≤75) from admission to discharge, and 1-month later.
Results
Of the 133 patients included, 24.8% and 19.6% had a BI≤75 at discharge and at 1-month, respectively. 
Compared with men, women had more than double risk for <dis>functional decline</dis> at discharge and 1-month (P<.05). 
Compared with those without delirium and <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>, those with delirium and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> had an increased risk for <dis>functional decline</dis> (BI≤75) at discharge (OR 5.15, 95% CI; 1.94-13.67), and at 1-month (OR 6.26, 95% CI; 2.30-17.03). 
Similarly, those with comorbidity (≥2) had increased <dis>functional decline</dis> at discharge (OR 2.36, 95% CI; 1.14-4.87), and at 1-month after discharge (OR 2.71, 95% CI; 1.25-5.89).
Conclusion
Delirium during hospitalisation, together with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> on admission, was a strong predictor of <dis>functional decline</dis>.Introduction.
The prevalence of pelvic fracture (PF) due to frailty is increasing, leading to an increase in <dis>functional impairment</dis> in the patient, as well as increasing morbidity and mortality. 
The aim of the present study is to gain knowledge about the sociodemographic characteristics, as well as the functional features, of patients admitted to hospital with PF and evaluated by a Geriatrics department. 
The functional burden of PF and the potential influence of geriatric interventions are also assessed.

Material and methods.
A retrospective study conducted between 1995 and 2015 on all patients older than 65 years old with PF admitted to the Traumatology department, and then assessed in the Geriatrics Department. 
Sociodemographic information was also collected (age, gender and place of residence), as well as data from the geriatric assessment (baseline situation and at hospital admission), hospital stay, within hospital mortality, and discharge.

Results.
The study included 271 patients with a mean age of 81.1±7 years, and mainly women (81.2%). 
The median hospital stay was 9 days (interquartile range 5 to 14 days). 
The ability to walk independently decreased after PF from 72.3% to 3.6%. 
Severe disability cases increased in activities of daily living from 7.9% to 79.5%. 
Within hospital mortality was 2.2%. 
As regards medical follow-up consultations, the mean length of stay was significantly reduced compared to the assessment consultations (10.0±7.8 vs 16.1±12.0 days, P<.001).
Conclusion.
PF patients evaluated by the Geriatrics Department were mainly women, with advanced age, and a <dis>severe functional impairment</dis> secondary to PF. 
The intervention of a geriatrician could contribute to optimise hospital resources.
Introduction.
The prevalence of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> <scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>dementia</dis></scp> (<dis>CIND</dis>) varies between 5.1% and 35.9%, increasing between 65 and 85 years. 
The <dis>CIND</dis> increases the risk of <dis>dementia</dis>. 
Factors such as education, occupation, and social activities are associated with the risk of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>. 
The main objective of this study was to analyse the association between the main occupation developed throughout life and <dis>CIND</dis> in a general population sample of over 55 years.

Methods.
In wave I of the ZARADEMP Project, a sample (n=4803) of people over 55 years was interviewed. 
<dis>CIND</dis> measurement was obtained through the Mini Mental State Examination. 
Occupational activity data were recoded into white collar, blue collar, homemakers, and farmers. 
The association between the occupation variables and <dis>CIND</dis> was estimated using the odds ratio, and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression equations.

Results.
The prevalence of <dis>CIND</dis> in the sample was 28.2%. 
As regards white collar workers, the <dis>CIND</dis> diagnosis odds was 53% higher for blue collar workers, 77% higher for women who were homemakers and almost twice for farmers, after controlling for socio-demographic, behavioural and clinical variables. 
All results were statistically significant.

Conclusions.
<dis>CIND</dis> frequency is influenced by the previous occupation of the subjects. 
An occupation with higher intellectual requirements can help keep cognitive functions intact for longer.
   Summary
<dis>Mental retardation</dis> is one of the greatest social-medical problem which the 20th century faces.
Genetic field advances has consented the recognition of some forms of <dis>mental retardation</dis> wich can be diagnosted nowadays with high reliability.
One of these forms is the fragile X syndrome (SXF), discovered in the early 80's and is actually recognized as the most common type of hereditary <dis>mental retardation</dis> ever known.
With heritage link with X cromosome, this symdrome could cause <dis>intellectual and cognoscitive deficit</dis> with ranges from slight difficulties in learning and an average quatient intellect to great <dis>mental retardation</dis> and <dis>autism</dis> behavior.
Until now, there is no cure to this symdrome, though many available treatments exist.
This is mainly applied through several tharepies, including special education, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.
Medical intervention is based in the use of stimulating medicine to treat the <dis>hyperactivity</dis> and lack of capacity of attention on children with SXF.
Other medicines can be useful for problems of aggresiveness, anxiety, depression and others.
With the purpose of creating and providing educative, therapeutic or good vocational programs, it’s important to consider the global development in each individual.
It’s necesary to evaluate the capacities of learning, the specific problems of behavior and medical necessities.
This recommendation is valid both in children and adults.Abstract
 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflamatory and demyelinative disease which affects central nervous system myelin.
The most characteristic clinic in MS is its variability, with signs and symptoms depending on the localitation of the injuries which can appear in all neuroaxis.
Today there isn’t a healing therapy in MS.
Thats why physiotherapy acquires an important value to maintain and/or improve the patient functional status.
Physiotherapist must adapt the treatment to the patient all the time, attending the disturbances which can appear when the disease progress.
The most common symptoms, spasticity, weakness, <dis>ataxia</dis>, fatigue and <dis>gait disturbances</dis>, will appear in a great number of patients with MS.
The physiotherapist role is to reduce these injuries through kynesitherapy and neurological physiotherapy techniques, in order to maintain an acceptable patient's life quality.
It has been done a review in these data bases: Medline, Embasse, IME, Cinhal, Cochrane of all publicated articles between 1987-2005 with these keywords: multiple sclerosis, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, spasticity, and in books which are related with the theme.
Abstract
 Objective
to verify if <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> can affect the total score obtained on the Freezing of Gait score (FOG-score) test in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
Material and method
A sectional, correlational non-exploratory study was carried out on thirty- four subjects, with mild to moderate PD disease.
The participants carried out the FOG-score test and cognitive evaluation: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and the Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME).
Motor function was assessed by the motor subscale of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (part III).
Results
there was a significant negative correlation between the FOG-score test and global cognition (MMSE) (r = .68; p < .001), memory-related parameters (FOME) (r = .64; _P_ < .001) and executive functions (FAB) (r = .57; _P_ < .001).
The motor scores held lower relation with FOG parameters (r = .35; _P_ > .005).
Conclusions
the results of this study suggest that <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> can strongly affect task performance of the FOG-score test.
This suggests the need to adjust the cut-off point when assessing PD patients suffering from <dis>cognitive dysfunction</dis>.
This could prevent the examiner from overestimating the existence and recurrence of freezing episodes in this population.Aim
To observe the differences between ethnic groups and the autochthonous population in the frequency of <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
To study epidemiological data and the accuracy of recording of such data.
Design
Descriptive study.
Setting
Raval Sud Basic Health Care Area.
Drassanes Primary Health Care Center, Barcelona, Spain.
Patients
A random sample of 112 immigrant patients belonging to ethnic minorities, seen between January 1995 and December 1997, matched for age and sex with autochthonous patients.
Interventions
We studied variables related with <dis>mental disorders</dis> in immigrants.
Variables included age, country of origin, reason for immigrating, employment status, marital status, other persons in household, educational level, knowledge of Spanish and toxic habits.
We recorded the following impressions of diagnosis: anxiety, depression, somatization, psychosis, <dis>personality disorder</dis>, number of visits for each diagnosis, treatment, and overall number of visits between January 1995 and December 1997.
Statistical studies consisted of descriptive analysis and chi-squared tests.
Measures and results
Mean age was 39 ± 14 years, 52.7% of the immigrant patients were men, 36.6% (95% CI, 27.6–45.5%) were from the Maghreb region, and 23.2% (95% CI, 15.4–31.0%) were Hindustani.
43% (95% CI, 33.6–52.0%) understood Spanish.
Smoking was more frequent among autochthonous patients (59.8%; 95% CI, 50.7–68.9%) than in immigrant patients (26.8%; 95% CI, 18.5–34.9%; p < 0.001), as was alcohol abuse (24.1%; 95% CI, 16.1–32.0%, versus 5.4%; 95% CI, 1.1–9.5%; p < 0.001).
Depression tended to be more frequent in patients belonging to ethnic groups (15.2%; 95% CI, 8.5–21.8%) than in autochthonous patients (13.4%; 95% CI, 7.0–19.7%; p = ns), as did somatization disorder (10.7%; 95% CI, 4.9–167.4%, versus 6.3%; 95% CI, 1.7–10.7%, p = ns), but was undertreated (19.8%; 95% CI, 2.4–27.2%, versus 32.1%; 95% CI, 23.4–40.7%; p = ns).
The total number of visits during the study period was higher in autochthonous patients (1138 versus 1017), as was the number of visits for <dis>mental disorders</dis> (17.9%; 95% CI, 15.7–20.1%, versus 13%; 95% CI, 1.9–15.0%; p = ns).
Conclusions
There were no differences in the percentages of <dis>mental disorders</dis> between immigrants and autochthonous residents, although depression and somatization disorder tended to be more frequent in the former group.
The characteristics of the reference population, and the frequency with which epidemiological data were missing from the medical record, might have biased the results; this in turn might have been influenced by communication problems which make the diagnosis in immigrants more difficult.
Health professionals should be appropriately trained to enable them to provide better care.Objective
To analyse the degree of monitoring by doctors, nurses, and other health professionals of patients taking psychotropic medication.
Design
Retrospective, observational study of patients of both sexes and over 15 years old, who took psychotropic medication and had attended a minimum of ten times the same doctor-nurse primary care unit (PCU).
Their monitoring during 2 year- long periods was studied: a first period (the first year after diagnosis) and a second period from October 2001 to October 2002.
Setting
Primary care in the Raval Sud District, Barcelona, Spain.
Participants
A total of 730 clinical histories were reviewed, of which 200 (27%) met inclusion criteria.
Results
The most common diagnosis was anxiety-depression disorder (58%), and 14.5% of patients had no recorded diagnosis.
35.5% were patients taking more than one medicine.
The most common drug group was the benzodiazepines (60.4%).
Significant differences in the number of controls were found between the 2 periods and between different PCUs.
The mean difference between periods was −0.5, with 95% CI at −1.0: clearly the degree of monitoring drops over time.
Conclusions
These patients’ follow-up was not monitored well, which poses the need to create clear aims and protocols for the doctor-nurse team, to thus assist the treatment of patients with <dis>mental health problems</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
Psychiatric comorbidity affects the impact, the prognosis and the management of depression.
Aims
To determine the prevalence of other <dis>common mental disorders</dis> in patients with major depression and to analyse their associated comorbidities.
Design
Two-stage cross-sectional study: _a)_ screening (Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale); _b)_ a standardised psychiatric interview.
Settings
Ten health centres in the province of Tarragona.
Patients
A total of 906 consecutive patients were screened.
In the second stage, the 209 patients who gave a positive result and 97 patients who gave a negative result (1/7 at random) were evaluated.
Analysis
The statistical analysis used weights that took into account the two-stage sampling.
The frequency with which dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and somatisation disorder presented concomitantly with major depression was determined.
The characteristics of the depressed patients were compared for different degrees of comorbidity.
Results
In 45.7% (95% CI, 32.8–59.2) of patients with major depression there was one other coexisting <dis>mental disorder</dis>, in 19.9% (95% CI, 13.7–27.9) two more <dis>mental disorders</dis> and in 8.3% (95% CI, 4.5–14.8) three more <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
Generalised anxiety disorder was present in 55.2% of depressed patients (95% CI, 41.6–68), panic disorder in 33.8% (95% CI, 21.1–47.1), dysthymia in 15.7% (95% CI, 10.3–23.4) and somatisation disorder in 6.6% (95% CI, 3.3-12.8).
In the groups of patients with comorbidity, the depression was more severe and had a greater functional impact.
There were no differences in the clinical management variables.
Conclusions
Psychiatric comorbidity of depression is common in primary care.
Most depressed patients suffer from other disorders, often anxiety.Abstract
 Aim
To determine the cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), level of cardiovascular risk (CVR) and to analyse the relationship between CVR and quality of life in patients with <dis>severe mental illness</dis> (<dis>SMI</dis>).
Design of study
Cross sectional study.
Setting
Mental Health Service, Consorci Hospitalari de Vic (Barcelona).
Subjects
Patients over 18 years diagnosed with <dis>SMI</dis>.
Main measurements
Data was collected on, socio-demographic variables, toxic habits, previous pathologies, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, psychiatric diagnoses, physical parameters and laboratory findings.
The CVR was determined by the SCORE and REGICOR scales.
Quality of life was measured by Euro-QoL and Seville Questionnaires.
Results
A total of 137 patients with <dis>SMI</dis> were included; 64.9% female, and a mean age 51.1 years (SD 12.9).
Major CVRF distribution: 40.1% smoking, 37.9% hypertension, 56.2% dyslipidemia, and 11.1% diabetes.
The criteria for obesity and metabolic syndrome were met by 37.9% and 48.4% of the patients, respectively.
The average major CVRF was 1.5 factors.
The CVR was high in 4.6% of the sample by SCORE and in 5.4% by REGICOR.
Neither the patients who accumulated more CVRF or those with high CVR scores showed a worse quality of life.
Conclusions
The most prevalent CVRF in patients with <dis>SMI</dis> are smoking and dyslipidemia, with a prevalence that exceeded population-based studies.
The subgroup of depressive disorders showed a higher CVR and worse quality of life.
No relationships were found between the CVR and the quality of life.Objective.
To identify predictors of frequent attenders (HF) in Primary Health Care (PHC) centres in a sample of frequent attenders (HF) in Emergency Departments (ED).

Design.
This was an observational, retrospective, multicentre cohort study.

Participants.
The HF patients were selected from patients seen in the ED between January 1 and December 31, 2013. 
Setting Patients were recruited from 17 public hospitals of the Community of Madrid, Spain.

Method.
Variables on the index visit to the ED were collected. 
The sample was analysed in terms of being or not being an HF user in PHC. 
An HF user is considered a patient who made at least 10 visits in each level of care for a year.

Results.
A total of 1284 HF patients were included. 
An analysis was performed on 423 (32.9%) HF users in ED with 16 (12-25) visits to PHC vs. 861 (67.1%) non-HF users in ED, with 4 (2-6) visits to PHC. 
Independent predictors of HF in PHC: over 65 years (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.07-2.13; P=.019), <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.01-2.65; P=.049), taking >3 drugs (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.06-2.30; P=.025), and living in the community vs. nursing home or homeless (OR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.14-8.16; P=.026).

Conclusions.
Among HF patients in the ED, the fact that of being over 65 years, taking 3or more drugs, suffering <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, and living in the community, are also considered to be predictors of HF in PHC.
Objective
To analyse the nutritional status of patients older than 65 years included in the home care program (PAD).
Design
Croos-sectional study.
Emplacement
3 urban health centers.
Participants
218 patients in the PAD.
Method
Mini Nutritional Assessment questionnaire (MNA) was applied. 
Sociodemographic, anthropometric, dependency, emotional and cognitive status and analytical parameters: 57 variables were collected. 
Possible associations were analysed by applying the chi square and variance analysis. 
The level of significance was considered to be P<.05 was considered.
Results
The mean age was 83.9 years (SD=7.4); 34.9% were institutionalized and 80.7% were women; 21.2% of patients were malnourished and 40.1% were at risk of it. 
A significant association was established between poorer nutritional status and older age, lower BMI, greater <dis>dependence on basic and instrumental activities of daily living</dis> and greater <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>. 
The lowest mean hemoglobin, albumin, and iron levels were also associated with malnutrition and risk of malnutrition.
Conclusions
More than half of PAD patients are malnourished or at risk for it, and a high proportion of them some laboratory abnormality susceptible to be corrected. 
Most <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and <dis>functional dependence</dis> are closely related to malnutrition; so patients with these characteristics should receive more attention from the nutritional point of view.Objective
To determine the prevalence and profiles of people with advanced chronic diseases in Primary Care and to analyse the elements related to their mortality in order to orient strategies for improvement in this level of care.
Design
An observational, analytical and prospective study during 3 years conducted on a cohort of patients with palliative needs.
Location
Three Primary Care teams of Osona (Catalonia).
Participants
A total of 251 people identified as advanced patients using a systematic population-based strategy that included the NECPAL tool.
Main measurements
Basic demographic and clinical profile (age, gender, type of residence, health stratification level and main disease); date, place, and cause of eventual deaths.
Results
1% of the adult Primary Care population suffer from advanced diseases, of which 56.6% are women, and with a median age of 85 years. 
<dis>Dementia</dis> or advanced frailty is observed in 49.3%, and only 13.7% have cancer. 
Just under one-quarter (24.3%) live in nursing homes. 
The accumulated mortality at 3 years is 62.1%, with a median survival of 23 months. 
Factors significantly associated with the likelihood of dying are cancer, female gender, and over-aging. 
Patients died at their home (47.3%), in an intermediate care hospital (37.2%), or in an acute care hospital (15.5%), depending on certain explanatory factors.
Conclusions
The prevalence and characteristics of advanced community-based disease coincide with that reported in the literature. 
Potentially, Primary Care is the reference level of care for these patients, especially if it incorporates nursing homes as a usual field of practice.Objective.
Identify attitudes and behaviors that evidence and characterize family adherence to treatment in patients with <dis>severe mental disorder</dis>.

Design.
Qualitative descriptive, from an interpretative social approach.

Location.
Chia, Colombia, with professionals in the psychiatric and geriatric settings.

Participants.
Twelve professionals in psychiatry, nursing and psychology, with experience in care of patients with <dis>serious mental disorder</dis> and their families.

Method.
Intentional sampling. 
Twelve semi-structured interviews were carried out. 
The analysis strategy was made from the procedures of constant comparison and open coding of the grounded theory. 
As validation strategies, triangulation was done between researchers and methods, as interviews and results survey.

Results.
Two categories of family adherence were defined: family and treatment (treatment cooperation, knowledge about the disease and attention to the disease evolution), and family attitudes towards the patient (patient's care, patient's promotion of autonomy, and affective attachment with the patient). 
A third category showed aspects that diminished family adherence, such as lack or distortion of information regarding <dis>mental disorder</dis>, or family and patient endurance attitudes.

Conclusions.
Participants agree about the relevance of the construct named «family adherence», which describes the behaviors and attitudes of the family regarding the treatment of patients with <dis>severe mental disorder</dis>. 
Family adherence can be seen as active participation behavior, but also as a process of strengthening relationships, which can reduce the burden and suffering on family members, caregivers and patients.
Abstract
 Introduction
Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) have been reported in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).
Nonetheless, their typical pattern still remains controversial regarding some features, such as basal ganglia involvement and the main cortical regions affected.
Functional neuroimaging makes it possible to identify the brain dysfunctions of the neural circuits underlying the disease.
Voxel-based analysis methods make it possible to increase the reliability of the results.
Objective
To assess the rCBF changes in patients with PD and their relation with disease duration.
Materials and methods
Thirty PD adult patients <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>dementia</dis></scp> underwent evaluation with 99mTc-ECD SPECT.
SPM5 was used for statistical comparison with 25 normal controls of similar ages.
The disease course duration in years was added as a covariate.
Additionally, patients with a 6-year evolution or less and those with more than 6 years were compared separately with normal controls.
Results
Significant hypoperfusion was detected in bilateral premotor and posterior parietal cortex and increase of perfusion was present in the cerebellum.
These changes correlated with the years of evolution of the illness.
Patients with longer evolution also presented thalamic, subthalamic and basal ganglia hypoperfusion.
Conclusions
We describe rCBF changes in PD in neural circuits related with control of movements.
These changes are more manifest in patients with a longer duration of the disease.Abstract
 Primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs during pregnancy in 1% to 4% of seronegative women and may be transmitted to the fetus in up to 40% of cases.
Up to 10% of intrauterine CMV infections result in symptomatic congenital disease at birth.
Half of these children and 13% of those born with asymptomatic infection will develop significant clinical sequelae in infancy, especially <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
Routine CMV screening during pregnancy is not recommended in Spain owing to the absence of an effective CMV vaccine, the lack of preventive measures or therapy during pregnancy, the difficulty in diagnosing a reactivated infection, and the possibility of symptomatic congenital infections in children of immune women.
However, sensitive and specific methods to diagnose primary maternal and fetal infection now exist, and new preventive and therapeutic measures have been developed.
Currently, these procedures are not universally available and need to be tested in larger trials.
Furthermore, the prevalence of seropositive status in pregnant women, the frequency of congenital infection, and the percentage of infants born with <dis>hearing impairment</dis> and <dis>mental retardation</dis> in our country are not known.
Therefore, it would not be appropriate to introduce routine screening for CMV in pregnancy at the present time.
However, increased efforts should be made to inform women about congenital CMV disease, to develop the diagnosis of fetal infection and methods to determine the extent of involvement in the case of suggestive ultrasound findings, and to treat symptomatic infected newborns with antivirals to reduce <dis>hearing impairment</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
Fragile X syndrome is an inherited form of <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
It results from an abnormally expanded number of trinucleotide CGG repeats.
Some grandfathers of these children become forgetful, have frequent falls and other neurological problems.
Researchers have found a connection between fragile X syndrome and the neurological symptoms in elderly men.
This resulted in the recognition of a syndrome originally referred to as “intention tremor, parkinsonism and generalised brain atrophy in carriers of a fragile X premutation”.
This premutation is also associated with premature ovarian failure.
Methodology
This paper reviews the literature on the neurological signs of fragile X premutation.
Conclusions
Fragile X premutation is a risk for <dis>movement disorders</dis> and <dis>cognitive dysfunction</dis> and it should be considered in patients with a family history of <dis>mental retardation</dis> or <dis>autism</dis>, and particularly in those females with premature ovarian failure.Abstract
 Introduction
The Fototest is a brief cognitive test suitable for illiterate persons, and valid and accurate for detecting <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> or <dis>dementia</dis>.
Our aim was to conclude the development of this instrument carrying out a normative and reliability study.
Method
The normative study was performed on a convenience sample of 223 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 85 years.
The test-retest reliability was assessed through a repeated-measures cross-sectional design on a sample of 50 subjects <scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>; the inter-rater reliability was determined by the blind assessment of 10 test applications performed by 30 independent observers; in both instances, reliability was expressed as intra- class correlation coefficient.
Internal consistency was analysed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient.
Results
The results on the Fototest are normally distributed and are not influenced by gender or educational level but they do vary with age.
The test-retest reliability of the Fototest was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.81-0.93); the inter-rater reliability, 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99); and the internal consistency, 0.94.
Conclusions
The Fototest is free from educational influence and shows appropriate test- retest and inter-rater reliabilities, as well as a high internal consistency.
Therefore, it is a suitable psychometric instrument to be used in the follow- up of patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> or <dis>dementia</dis>, especially in contexts where evaluators are not the same on different occasions, or with patients of low educational level.Abstract
 Introduction
Anxiety has negative effects on the cognitive performance and psychosocial adjustment of elderly people.
Given the high prevalence of anxiety symptoms in patients suffering from <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, it has been suggested that these symptoms may be an early marker of <dis>dementia</dis>.
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is one of the most widely-used scales for evaluating anxiety in elderly people.
However, inasmuch as the STAI may be difficult to apply to older people, having a short form of it would be desirable.
Methods
The participants comprised 489 community-dwelling individuals aged 68 years and over.
All of them were volunteers in a longitudinal study for early detection of Alzheimer’ Disease (Proyecto Vallecas).
The full sample was divided in two homogeneous subgroups: Group A, used to reduce the number of items and response options, and Group B, the group used to determine the psychometric properties of the new short form (STAIr).
Results
A dichotomous Rasch model was used to obtain the STAIr.
No statistically significant differences for STAIr scores were found with respect to sociodemographic variables.
Psychometric properties and normative data were obtained for the new short version.
Conclusions
The STAIr is composed of 13 items and data fits the model well.
Since it is short and easy to apply to elderly people, STAIr will be very useful in clinical and research settings.Abstract
 Background
Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of <dis>intellectual disability</dis>, is associated with a broad spectrum of disorders across different generations of a single family.
This study reviews the clinical manifestations of fragile X-associated disorders as well as the spectrum of mutations of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene ( _FMR1_ ) and the neurobiology of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and also provides an overview of the potential therapeutic targets and genetic counselling.
Development
This disorder is caused by expansion of the CGG repeat (> 200 repeats) in the 5 prime untranslated region of _FMR1_ , resulting in a deficit or absence of FMRP.
FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of several genes that are important in synaptic plasticity and dendritic maturation.
It is believed that CGG repeat expansions in the premutation range (55 to 200 repeats) elicit an increase in mRNA levels of _FMR1_ , which may cause neuronal toxicity.
These changes manifest clinically as developmental problems such as <dis>autism</dis> and <dis>learning disabilities</dis> as well as neurodegenerative diseases including fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
Conclusions
Advances in identifying the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome may help us understand the causes of <dis>neuropsychiatric disorders</dis>, and they will probably contribute to development of new and specific treatments.Abstract
 Objective
To determine the prospective validity of Test Your Memory (TYM) and its sensitivity to change in cognitive state.
Methods
This longitudinal prospective study followed 71 patients with subjective cognitive symptoms and 48 with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> for a mean time period of 35.2 ± 15 months.
Subjects did <scp><neg>not</neg> have <dis>dementia</dis> or depression at the beginning of follow-up</scp> and each participant was given the TYM at least two times.
A psychometric threshold was established to determine presence of a <dis>cognitive deficit</dis> (z-score ≤ 1.5 on at least one cognitive domain) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia scale was used to ensure full functional ability.
The criterion for deterioration was a change in the stage on the Global Deterioration Scale.
Results
Sixty-one patients remained cognitively stable and 58 worsened.
There were no differences between them with respect to sex, educational attainment, the initial stage on the GDS, or the score on the first TYM.
Subjects who worsened were older than those who did not.
The TYM increased an average of 0.04 points per month in patients who remained stable or improved (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.08) and decreased an average of 0.14 points per month in those whose condition worsened (95% CI, -0.19 to -0.09).
Subjects with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> who worsened displayed a sharper loss of TYM points than did subjects with subjective cognitive symptoms.
Conclusions
While the TYM lacks prospective validity, it is sensitive to changes in cognitive state.Introduction
<dis>Gait impairment</dis>, a frequent sign in multiple sclerosis (MS), places a major burden on patients since it results in <dis>progressive loss of personal and social autonomy, along with work productivity</dis>. 
This guide aims to provide recommendations on how to evaluate <dis>gait impairment</dis> and use prolonged-release fampridine (PR-fampridine) as treatment for MS patients with <dis>gait impairment</dis> in Spain.
Development
PR-fampridine dosed at 10mg every 12hours is currently the only drug approved to treat <dis>gait impairment</dis> in adults with MS. 
Additionally, PR-fampridine has been shown in clinical practice to significantly improve quality of life (QoL) in patients who respond to treatment. 
Treatment response can be assessed with the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) or the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12); tests should be completed before and after starting treatment. 
The minimum time recommended for evaluating treatment response is 2 weeks after treatment onset. 
Patients are considered responders and permitted to continue the treatment when they demonstrate a decrease in their T25FW time or an increase in MSWS-12 scores. 
A re-evaluation is recommended at least every 6 months. 
The SF-36 (Short Form-36) and the MSIS-29 (MS Impact Scale-29) tests are recommended for clinicians interested in performing a detailed QoL assessment. 
This drug is generally well-tolerated and has a good safety profile. 
It should be taken on an empty stomach and renal function must be monitored regularly.
Conclusions
These recommendations will help ensure safer and more efficient prescription practices and easier management of PR-fampridine as treatment for <dis>gait impairment</dis> in Spanish adults with MS.Introduction
<dis>Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia</dis> (<dis>BPSD</dis>), present in the vast majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), cause <dis>extensive impairment in all areas, including functionality</dis>. 
Early diagnosis and management are critical, especially since these symptoms are not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a diagnostic criterion of AD, but only as specific features of some patients. 
The main purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of these behavioural and psychological symptoms of <dis>dementia</dis>, particularly in AD. 
In addition, we discuss why these symptoms have not been included in the latest DSM-V.
Development
We conducted a literature search through various databases to gather data about <dis>BPSD</dis> in AD, and found a total of 12 articles.
Conclusions
BPSD are present in almost all patients and result in <dis>cognitive and functional impairment</dis>. 
The prevalence of these symptoms varies depending on the study and the symptom in question. 
In our view, <dis>BPSD</dis> should be included among the DSM diagnostic criteria for AD.Introduction
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a therapeutic reality in post-stroke rehabilitation. 
It has a neuroprotective effect on the modulation of neuroplasticity, improving the brain's capacity to retrain neural circuits and promoting restoration and acquisition of new compensatory skills.
Development
We conducted a literature search on PubMed and also gathered the latest books, clinical practice guidelines, and recommendations published by the most prominent scientific societies concerning the therapeutic use of rTMS in the rehabilitation of stroke patients. 
The criteria of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (2014) were followed regarding the inclusion of all evidence and recommendations.
Conclusions
Identifying stroke patients who are eligible for rTMS is essential to accelerate their recovery. 
rTMS has proven to be safe and effective for treating stroke complications. 
Functional brain activity can be optimised by applying excitatory or inhibitory electromagnetic pulses to the hemisphere ipsilateral or contralateral to the lesion, respectively, as well as at the level of the transcallosal pathway to regulate interhemispheric communication. 
Different studies of rTMS in these patients have resulted in improvements in <dis>motor disorders</dis>, <dis>aphasia</dis>, <dis>dysarthria</dis>, <dis>oropharyngeal dysphagia</dis>, depression, and <dis>perceptual-cognitive deficits</dis>. 
However, further well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials with larger sample size are needed to recommend with a higher level of evidence, proper implementation of rTMS use in stroke subjects on a widespread basis.Introduction
The aim of our study is to describe the types of <dis>dementia</dis> found in a series of patients and to estimate the level of agreement between the clinical diagnosis and post-mortem diagnosis.
Material and Methods
We conducted a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of the types of <dis>dementia</dis> found in our series and we established the level of concordance between the clinical and the post-mortem diagnoses. 
The diagnosis was made based on current diagnostic criteria.
Results
114 cases were included. 
The most common clinical diagnoses both at a clinical and autopsy level were Alzheimer disease and <dis>mixed dementia</dis> but the prevalence was quite different. 
While at a clinical level, prevalence was 39% for Alzheimer disease and 18% for <dis>mixed dementia</dis>, in the autopsy level, prevalence was 22% and 34%, respectively. 
The agreement between the clinical and the autopsy diagnoses was 62% (95% CI 53-72%).
Conclusions
Almost a third of our patients were not correctly diagnosed in vivo. 
The most common mistake was the underdiagnosis of cerebrovascular pathology.Introduction
The objective of the EPICON Project is to develop a set of recommendations on how to adequately switch from carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) to eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in some patients with epilepsy.
Methods
A steering committee drafted a questionnaire of 56 questions regarding the transition from CBZ or OXC to ESL in clinical practice (methodology and change situation). 
The questionnaire was then distributed to 54 epilepsy experts in 2 rounds using the Delphi method. 
An agreement/disagreement consensus was defined when a median ≥ 7 points or ≤ 3 was achieved, respectively, and a relative interquartile range ≤ 0.40. 
We analysed the results obtained to reach our conclusions.
Results
Our main recommendations were the following: switching from CBZ to ESL must be carried out over a period of 1 to 3 weeks with a CBZ:ESL dose ratio of 1:1.3 and is recommended for patients who frequently forget to take their medication, those who work rotating shifts, polymedicated patients, subjects with <dis>cognitive problems</dis>, severe osteoporosis–osteopaenia, dyslipidaemia, or liver disease other than acute liver failure, as well as for men with erectile dysfunction caused by CBZ. 
The transition from OXC to ESL can take place overnight with an OXC:ESL dose ratio of 1:1 and it is recommended for patients who frequently forget to take their medication, those who work rotating shifts, polymedicated patients, or those with <dis>cognitive problems</dis>. 
The transition was not recommended for patients with prior rash due to CBZ or OXC use.
Conclusion
The EPICON Project offers a set of recommendations about the clinical management of switching from CBZ or OXC to ESL, using the Delphi method.Introduction
Brain microbleeds (BMB) are haemosiderin deposits contained within macrophages, which are displayed as hypointense images in some T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences. 
There are still many questions to be answered about the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of BMB.
Development
We conducted a literature review of the main epidemiological, clinical, and anatomical pathology studies of BMB performed in the general population, in patients at risk of or already suffering from a vascular disease, and in patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>. 
We analysed the prevalence of BMB, risk factors, and potential pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical implications.
Conclusions
The prevalence of BMB is highly variable (3%-27% in the general population, 6%-80% in patients with vascular risk factors or vascular disease, and 16%-45% in patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>). 
BMB are associated with ageing, Alzheimer disease (AD), and in particular haemorrhagic or ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. 
The pathological substrate of BMB is either lipohyalinosis (subcortical BMB) or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (lobar BMB). 
BMB exacerbate <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, possibly through cortical-subcortical and intracortical disconnection, and increase the risk of death, mostly due to vascular causes. 
BMB also increase the risk of cerebral haemorrhage, particularly in patients with multiple lobar BMB (probable erebral amyloid angiopathy). 
Therefore, anticoagulant treatment may be contraindicated in these patients. 
In patients with lower risk of bleeding, the new oral anticoagulants and the combination of clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up could be helpful in the decision-making process.Introduction.
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which results in a significant decrease in dopamine levels and consequent <dis>functional motor impairment</dis>.

Development.
Although its aetiology is not fully understood, several pathogenic mechanisms, including oxidative stress, have been proposed. 
Current therapeutic approaches are based on dopamine replacement drugs; these agents, however, are not able to stop or even slow disease progression. 
Novel therapeutic approaches aimed at acting on the pathways leading to neuronal dysfunction and death are under investigation.

Conclusions.
In recent years, such natural molecules as polyphenols, alkaloids, and saponins have been shown to have a neuroprotective effect due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
The aim of our review is to analyse the most relevant studies worldwide addressing the benefits of some phytochemicals used in in vitro models of Parkinson's disease.
Introduction.
We aim to describe the use of emergency electroencephalogram (EmEEG) by the on-call neurologist when nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is suspected, and in other indications, in a tertiary hospital.

Subjects and methods.
Observational retrospective cohort study of emergency EEG (EmEEG) recordings with 8-channel systems performed and analysed by the on-call neurologist in the emergency department and in-hospital wards between July 2013 and May 2015. 
Variables recorded were sex, age, symptoms, first diagnosis, previous seizure and cause, previous stroke, cancer, brain computed tomography, diagnosis after EEG, treatment, patient progress, routine control EEG (rEEG), and final diagnosis. 
We analysed frequency data, sensitivity, and specificity in the diagnosis of NCSE.

Results.
The study included 135 EEG recordings performed in 129 patients; 51.4% were men and their median age was 69 years. 
In 112 cases (83%), doctors ruled out suspected NCSE because of altered level of consciousness in 42 (37.5%), <dis>behavioural abnormalities</dis> in 38 (33.9%), and <dis>aphasia</dis> in 32 (28.5%). 
The EmEEG diagnosis was NCSE in 37 patients (33%), and this was confirmed in 35 (94.6%) as the final diagnosis. 
In 3 other cases, NCSE was the diagnosis on discharge as confirmed by rEEG although the EmEEG missed this condition at first. 
EmEEG performed to rule out NCSE showed 92.1% sensitivity, 97.2% specificity, a positive predictive value of 94.6%, and a negative predictive value of 96%.

Conclusions.
Our experience finds that, in an appropriate clinical context, EmEEG performed by the on-call neurologist is a sensitive and specific tool for diagnosing NCSE.
Objective
To analyse cognitive skills in patients with <dis>severe unilateral hearing loss</dis> versus those in subjects with normal hearing.
Methods
40 adults participated: 20 patients (10 women and 10 men) with <dis>severe unilateral hearing loss</dis> and 20 healthy subjects matched to the study group. 
Cognitive abilities were measured with the Spanish version of the Woodcock Johnson Battery-Revised; central auditory processing was assessed with monaural psychoacoustic tests. 
Box plots were drawn and t tests were performed for samples with a significance of P≤.05.
Results
A comparison of performances on the filtered word testing and time-compressed disyllabic word tests between patients and controls revealed a statistically significant difference (P≤.05) with greater variability among responses by <dis>hearing impaired subjects</dis>. 
This same group also showed a better cognitive performance on the numbers reversed, visual auditory learning, analysis synthesis, concept formation, and incomplete words tests.
Conclusions
Patients with <dis>hearing loss</dis> performed more poorly than controls on the filtered word and time-compressed disyllabic word tests, but more competently on memory, reasoning, and auditory processing tasks. 
Complementary tests, such as those assessing central auditory processes and cognitive ability tests, are important and helpful for designing habilitation/rehabilitation and therapeutic strategies intended to optimise and stimulate cognitive skills in subjects with <dis>unilateral hearing impairment</dis>.Introduction.
Transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) typically arises as an autonomic neuropathy primarily affecting small fibres and it occurs in adult patients in their second or third decades of life. 
It progresses rapidly and can lead to death in approximately 10 years. 
Other phenotypes have been described in non-endemic areas.

Objectives and methods.
We described 4 cases from the Spanish province of Guipuzcoa, a non-endemic area, to highlight the clinical variability of this disease.

Patients and results.
Three patients presented a late-onset form manifesting after the age of 50, featuring a predominantly motor polyneuropathy initially causing distal impairment of the lower limbs followed by the upper limbs. 
One patient suffered severe neuropathic pain. 
None showed signs of autonomic involvement. 
The fourth patient, of Portuguese descent, presented a typical form with onset in her thirties, neuropathic pain and <dis>dysautonomia</dis>. 
All patients carry the Val50Met mutation in the TTR gene.

Conclusion.
FAP is a pleomorphic disease even in patients carrying the same mutation. 
In non-endemic areas, its main form of presentation may resemble a predominantly motor polyneuropathy developing in the sixth decade of life <scp>with <neg>no signs</neg> of <dis>dysautonomia</dis></scp>. 
Given this non-specific presentation and the widely available technical means of studying the TTR gene, we believe that the protocol for the aetiological diagnosis of any polyneuropathy should include genetic sequencing of TTR.
Introduction
Periodontal disease and <dis>dementia</dis> are very prevalent, especially in elderly populations. 
Multiple studies have shown a link between these diseases; however, the conditions are highly heterogeneous and so is the diagnostic methodology, which may hinder interpretation and comparison of the results. 
The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of the literature linking these 2 processes.
Development
We retrieved 22 studies, most of which were retrospective, and analysed various methodological variables including study population, diagnosis of periodontitis, definition of <dis>dementia</dis>, adjusted variables, and results. 
The different aetiopathogenic mechanisms that may affect the progression and interaction of these 2 conditions were also analysed.
Conclusions
Although available evidence indicates a positive association between periodontitis and <dis>dementia</dis>, both the strength of that association and the presence of a causal relationship have yet to be determined.Introduction
Dementia units (DU) provide comprehensive and specialised care to patients with <dis>dementia</dis>. 
However, assessment in these units normally focuses on patient management. 
The aim of this study was to determine satisfaction of the caregivers of patients managed in a DU and how they rated DU care.
Methods
We created a self-administered questionnaire which was completed by 236 caregivers visiting the DU in 2015. 
The questionnaire included 6 dimensions (accessibility, organisation, professionalism, relationship with staff, information, and facilities); data were analysed using problem rates.
Results
A total of 53.4% caregivers completed the questionnaire; most were women, patients’ spouses, or first-degree relatives. 
The overall problem rates was 15.0% (95% CI, 13.9-16.1), with sizeable differences between dimensions: from 0.1% (95% CI, 0.0-0.4) for ‘relationship with staff’ and ‘professionalism’ to 49.3% (95% CI, 45.4-53.2) for ‘information’. 
Waiting times over 30minutes were perceived as excessive. 
Information problems were not directly related to patient management. 
Satisfaction was scored 8.29/10 (median 8; SD 1.45); 77.3% (95% CI, 69.8-74.8) of respondents were highly satisfied. 
Ninety-nine percent of the caregivers stated that they would recommend the DU.
Conclusions
This questionnaire provides interesting data on care quality as perceived by patients’ caregivers. 
Our results have allowed us to identify problems and implement corrective actions. 
Our questionnaire has proved to be a useful tool for evaluating and improving care quality in DUs.Background and purpose.
Pneumonia as a complication of stroke is associated with poor outcomes. 
The A2DS2 and ISAN scales were developed by German and English researchers, respectively, to predict in-hospital stroke-associated pneumonia. 
We conducted an external validation study of these scales in a series of consecutive patients admitted to our hospital due to ischaemic stroke.

Method.
These predictive models were applied to a sample of 340 consecutive patients admitted to hospital in 2015 due to stroke. 
Discrimination was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve for diagnostic efficacy. 
Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and graphing the corresponding curve. 
Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of respiratory infection secondary to stroke.

Results.
We included 285 patients, of whom 45 (15.8%) had respiratory infection after stroke according to the study criteria. 
Mean age was 71.01±12.62 years; men accounted for 177 of the patients (62.1%). 
Seventy-two patients (25.3%) had signs or symptoms of <dis>dysphagia</dis>, 42 (14.7%) had atrial fibrillation, and 14 (4.9%) were <dis>functionally dependent</dis> before stroke; the median NIHSS score was 4 points. 
Mean scores on A2DS2 and ISAN were 3.25±2.54 and 6.49±3.64, respectively. 
Our analysis showed that higher A2DS2 scores were associated with an increased risk of infection (OR=1.576; 95% CI: 1.363-1.821); the same was true for ISAN scores (OR=1.350; 95% CI: 1.214-1.501).

Conclusion.
High scores on A2DS2 and ISAN were found to be a strong predictor of respiratory infection associated with acute stroke in a cohort of consecutive patients with stroke. 
These easy-to-use scales are promising tools for predicting this complication in routine clinical practice.
Introduction.
A considerable percentage of events initially diagnosed as ischaemic stroke have non-cerebrovascular causes; these are called stroke mimics (SM). 
Currently available evidence about these events is heterogeneous and comes from studies with small samples.

Objective.
The purpose of our study is to identify conditions that may present as SM, define their epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and determine the percentage of cases of SM treated with intravenous fibrinolysis.

Methods.
Prospective study including all patients admitted to a tertiary university hospital between June 2005 and April 2015 with a diagnosis of acute stroke. 
We analysed demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, time from code stroke activation to admission, stroke severity (NIHSS), final destination after discharge, degree of disability (mRS), and treatment. 
We compared SM and ischaemic strokes. 
We ruled out patients with intracranial haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or other causes of SM that may be detected on the baseline CT scan.

Results.
Four hundred four of the 4,570 included patients (8.8%) were found to have SM. 
Patients with SM were younger (70.3 vs. 74, P<.0001), less likely to exhibit cardiovascular risk factors and atrial fibrillation (13 vs. 34%, P<.0001), scored lower on the NIHSS at baseline (2 vs. 4, P<.0001), and included fewer cases of <dis>aphasia</dis> (9.4 vs. 19.6%, P<.02) and <dis>dysphagia</dis> (1.2 vs. 17%, P<.0001) than patients with stroke. 
SM caused fewer code stroke activations (28 vs. 40%, P<.0001). 
Patients with SM required shorter hospital stays (4.9 vs. 7.8 days, P<.0001), were less frequently admitted to the stroke unit (47 vs. 60%, P<.0001) and more frequently discharged home (95 vs. 62%, P<.0001), and had better outcomes (mRS scores 0-2; 76 vs. 54%, P<.0001). 
Intravenous fibrinolysis was administered to 4.7% of these patients. 
Epileptic seizures were the most frequent cause of SM (26%).

Conclusions.
In our sample, 8.8% of all diagnoses of ischaemic stroke were SM. 
These events have different demographic, clinical, and prognostic characteristics; epilepsy is the most common aetiology. 
Despite receiving specialised emergency care, 19 patients with SM (4.7%) were treated with intravenous fibrinolysis.
Objective.
Thirty percent of the patients for whom code stroke is activated have stroke mimics, the most common being epilepsy. 
Our purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of multiparametric CT for differentiating between seizure-related symptoms and vascular events.

Material and methods.
We conducted a retrospective observational study; data were gathered prospectively during one year. 
We studied multiparametric CT images of patients admitted following code stroke activation and finally diagnosed with epilepsy.

Results.
The study included a total of 11 patients; 36% were men and mean age was 74.5 years. 
Three patients had right hemisphere syndrome, 4 displayed left hemisphere syndrome, and the remaining 4 had <dis>isolated aphasia</dis>. 
Maximum time from symptom onset to multiparametric CT study was 8.16hours. 
Perfusion CT results were normal in 2 patients. 
Nine patients showed longer or shorter times to peak (Tmax); cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps varied. 
EEG was performed a maximum of 47.6hours after symptom onset. 
Four patients showed findings compatible with status epilepticus, 2 displayed focal epileptiform activity, and 5 showed post-ictal slowing ipsilateral to perfusion CT abnormalities.

Conclusion.
The most sensitive parameter for differentiating between stroke and epilepsy in our series was increased time to peak in multilobar cortical locations in the absence of large-vessel occlusion and basal ganglia involvement. 
Multiparametric CT is a fast, readily available, and useful tool for the differential diagnosis of acute-onset neurological signs of epileptic origin in patients initially attended after code stroke activation.
Introduction
<dis>REM sleep behaviour disorder</dis> (<dis>RBD</dis>) is characterised by violent behaviours (screaming, kicking, vivid dreams) during REM sleep. 
It has a prevalence of 1% to 2% of the general population and is especially frequent in men and the population older than 60. 
In the last decade, <dis>RBD</dis> has been suggested to be a prodrome of neurodegenerative disease. 
We analysed associated neurological diseases and responses to drug treatment in 33 patients with <dis>RBD</dis> treated in the multidisciplinary sleep disorders unit at Hospital Infanta Sofía.
Patients and methods
We conducted an observational descriptive retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with <dis>RBD</dis> and treated in our multidisciplinary sleep disorders unit between October 2012 and December 2015. 
We recorded age, sex, associated diseases, and treatments administered to these patients.
Results
A total of 365 patients were attended at our unit, including 33 with <dis>RBD</dis>: 13 women (40%) and 20 men (60%). 
Mean age was 62.72 years. 
An associated disorder was identified in 48%, with the most common being <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> (69%). 
The percentage of patients with <dis>RBD</dis> and an associated disorder among patients older than 60 was 68%. 
Eighty-two percent of the patients required treatment. 
The most commonly used drug was clonazepam (76%), followed by melatonin (9%), gabapentin (6%), and trazodone (3%).
Discussion
In our series, 48% of the patients had an associated disorder. 
The likelihood of detecting an associated disorder increases with patients’ age. 
The vast majority of patients required drug treatment due to symptom severity; the most frequently administered drug was clonazepam (76%).Introduction
Acute cerebellitis is a rare inflammatory disease with a highly variable clinical course that ranges from benign self-limiting symptoms to a fulminant presentation associated with a high risk of death due to compression of the posterior fossa, acute hydrocephalus, and intracranial hypertension.
Methods
We reviewed clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings from children diagnosed with acute cerebellitis between May 2007 and November 2016. 
We analysed treatments and clinical and radiological progression.
Results
Nine children met the diagnostic criteria for cerebellitis. 
Headache, vomiting, and drowsiness were the most frequent initial symptoms; <dis>ataxia</dis>, <dis>dysarthria</dis>, and dysmetria were the most common cerebellar signs. 
Cerebellitis was diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed cerebellar involvement (unilateral or bilateral); computerised tomography images either were normal or showed indirect signs such as triventricular hydrocephalus due to extrinsic compression of the aqueduct of Sylvius. 
Corticosteroids were the most commonly used treatment (6 patients). 
One patient required surgery due to triventricular hydrocephalus. 
Eight patients recovered completely, whereas the ninth displayed neurological sequelae.
Conclusions
Cerebellitis is a medical and surgical emergency; diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion and an emergency brain magnetic resonance imaging study. 
It is a clinical-radiological syndrome characterised by acute or subacute encephalopathy with intracranial hypertension and cerebellar syndrome associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensities in the cerebellar cortex (unilaterally or bilaterally) and possible triventricular dilatation. 
Treatment is based on high-dose corticosteroids and may require external ventricular drain placement and decompressive surgery.Introduction
Few studies have validated the Spanish-language version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-S) test in Latin American populations.
Objetive
To evaluate the psychometric properties and discriminant validity of the MoCA-S in elderly patients in Santiago de Chile.
Methods
172 individuals were grouped according to their clinical diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale as follows: <dis>amnestic mild cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>aMCI</dis>; n±24), <dis>non-amnestic MCI</dis> (<dis>naMCI</dis>; n±24), <dis>mild dementia</dis> (n±20), and cognitively normal (n±104). 
Participants were evaluated with both the MoCA-S and the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) to determine the discriminant validity of the MoCA-S.
Results
Mean age and years of schooling were 73±6 and 11±4 years, respectively, with no significant intergroup differences. 
The MoCA-S displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α: 0.772), high inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.846; P<.01), and high intra-rater reliability (test-retest reliability coefficient: 0.922; P<.001). 
The MoCA-S was found to be an effective and valid test for detecting <dis>aMCI</dis> (AUC±0.903) and <dis>mild dementia</dis> (AUC±0.957); its effectiveness for detecting <dis>naMCI</dis> was lower (AUC±0.629). 
The optimal cut-off points for <dis>aMCI</dis> and <dis>mild dementia</dis> were<21 and<20, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 75% and 82% for <dis>aMCI</dis> and 90% and 86% for <dis>mild dementia</dis>. 
The level of education had a great impact on scores: as a result, 2 points were added for patients with less than 8 years of schooling and one point for patients with 8-12 years of schooling (MoCA-S1-2). 
The MoCA-S1-2 showed significantly greater discriminant validity than the MMSE for differentiating aMCI from <dis>dementia</dis>.
Conclusions
The MoCA-S1-2 is a short, easy-to-use, and useful test for diagnosing <dis>aMCI</dis> and <dis>mild dementia</dis>.Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurocutaneous syndrome often associated with <dis>specific cognitive deficits</dis> that are rarely monitored during follow-up of these patients.
Objective
The purpose of our study is two-fold. 
First, we aimed to describe the cognitive profile of patients with NF1 and detect <dis>disorders in higher brain functions</dis> associated with the disease.
Second, we identified the reasons for consultation associated with school performance in these patients.
Methods
We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of 24 paediatric patients (ages 5 to 16) with NF1 who underwent neuropsychological assessment.
Results
The most frequent reasons for consultation were <dis>attention deficits</dis> (58.33%), <dis>learning disorders</dis> (25%), poor motor coordination (25%), and <dis>language impairment</dis> (0.8%). 
Although 96% of the patients displayed impairments in at least one of the assessed areas, only 83.34% of the parents had reported such impairments. 
<dis>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</dis> was present in 58.33% of the patients, whereas 33.33% had <dis>nonverbal learning disabilities</dis>, 20.83% had <dis>expressive language disorder</dis>, 8.33% had borderline intellectual functioning, 4.16% had <dis>mental retardation</dis>, and only 4.16% showed <scp><neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.
Conclusion
Higher brain functions are frequently impaired in paediatric patients with NF1. 
Although many parents report such disorders, they can go undetected in some cases. 
Neuropsychological assessment is recommended for all paediatric patients with NF1 to detect <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and provide early, effective rehabilitation treatment.Objectives
To describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients with epilepsy from a reference centre in Colombia.
Methods
Cross-sectional study including patients diagnosed with epilepsy who attended our epilepsy centre (Neurocentro) between 2013 and 2016. 
Data were gathered from patients’ medical histories.
Results
We gathered data from a total of 354 patients diagnosed with epilepsy. 
Median age was 37 years; 52% were men. 
Seizures were focal in 57% of the patients and generalised in 38%; seizure type was not determined in 6% of the sample. 
The most frequent aetiology was cryptogenic (21%), followed by traumatic (14%). 
Median time of disease progression and age at onset were 23 and 11 years, respectively. 
Psychiatric comorbidities were found in 18% of the patients and 40% had some degree of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>. 
Around 40% of our sample reported adverse reactions to antiepileptic drugs at some point during treatment. 
Antiepileptic drugs were administered in monotherapy in 36% of the patients. 
Around 37% had drug-resistant epilepsy and 14% underwent surgery.
Conclusions
Psychiatric comorbidities, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, adverse drug reactions, and drug-resistant epilepsy are common among epileptic patients in Colombia. 
Knowledge of the factors with an impact on epilepsy may lay the foundations for improving management of these patients on the administrative level and improving quality of life.Introduction
In humans and animal models, Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterised by accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, neuronal degeneration, and astrocytic gliosis, especially in vulnerable brain regions (hippocampus and cortex). 
These alterations are associated with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>loss of memory</dis>) and <dis>non-cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>motor impairment</dis>). 
The purpose of this study was to identify cell changes (neurons and glial cells) and aggregation of Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the primary motor cortex (M1) in 3xTg-AD mouse models at an intermediate stage of AD.
Methods
We used female 3xTg-AD mice aged 11 months and compared them to non-transgenic mice of the same age. 
In both groups, we assessed motor performance (open field test) and neuronal damage in M1 using specific markers: BAM10 (extracellular Aβ aggregates), tau 499 (hyperphosphorylated tau protein), GFAP (astrocytes), and Klüver-Barrera staining (neurons).
Results
Female 3xTg-AD mice in intermediate stages of the disease displayed motor and cellular alterations associated with Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposition in M1.
Conclusions
Patients with AD display signs and symptoms of <dis>functional impairment</dis> from early stages. 
According to our results, M1 cell damage in intermediate-stage AD affects motor function, which is linked to progression of the disease.Introduction
This paper analyses the correlations between scores on scales assessing impairment, psychological distress, disability, and quality of life in patients with <dis>peripheral facial palsy</dis> (<dis>PFP</dis>).
Material and methods
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study including 30 patients in whom <dis>PFP</dis> had not resolved completely. 
We used tools for assessing impairment (Sunnybrook Facial Grading System [FGS]), psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), disability (Facial Disability Index [FDI]), and quality of life (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation [FaCE] scale).
Results
We found no correlations between FGS and HADS scores, or between FGS and FDI social function scores. 
However, we did find a correlation between FGS and FDI physical function scores (r=0.54; P<.01), FDI total score (r=0.4; P<.05), FaCE total scores (ρ=0.66; P<.01), and FaCE social function scores (ρ=0.5; P<.01). 
We also observed a correlation between HADS Anxiety scores and FDI physical function (r=–0.47; P<.01), FDI social function (r=–0.47; P<.01), FDI total (r=–0.55; P<.01), FaCE total (ρ=–0.49; P<.01), and FaCE social scores (ρ=–0.46; P<.05). 
Significant correlations were also found between HADS Depression scores and FDI physical function (r=–0.61; P<.01), FDI social function (r=–0.53; P<.01), FDI total (r=–0.66; P<.01), FaCE total (ρ=–0.67; P<.01), and FaCE social scores (ρ=–0.68; P<.01), between FDI physical function scores and FaCE total scores (ρ=0.87; P<.01) and FaCE social function (ρ=0.74; P<.01), between FDI social function and FaCE total (ρ=0.66; P<.01) and FaCE social function scores (ρ=0.72; P<.01), and between FDI total scores and FaCE total (ρ = 0,87; P<.01) and FaCE social function scores (ρ=0.84; P<.01).
Conclusion
In our sample, patients with more severe impairment displayed greater <dis>physical and global disability</dis> and poorer quality of life without significantly higher levels of <dis>social disability</dis> and psychological distress. 
Patients with more disability experienced greater psychological distress and had a poorer quality of life. 
Lastly, patients with more psychological distress also had a poorer quality of life.Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-SN) on cognitive function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) 5 years after surgery.
Material and methods
We conducted a prospective study including 50 patients with PD who underwent DBS-SN (62.5% were men; mean age of 62.2±8.2 years; mean progression time of 14.1±6.3 years). 
All patients were assessed before the procedure and at one year after surgery; 40 patients were further followed up until the 5-year mark. 
Follow-up assessments included the following neuropsychological tests: Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), letter-number sequencing of the WAIS-III (WAIS-III-LN), clock-drawing test, Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT), Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) test, FAS Phonemic Verbal Fluency Test, Stroop test, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
Results
Patients were found to score lower on the MMSE (−0.89%), clock-drawing test (−2.61%), MDRS (−1.72%), and especially phonemic (−13.28%) and sematic verbal fluency tests (−12.40%) at one year after surgery. 
Delayed recall on the RAVLT worsened one year after the procedure (−10.12%). 
At 5 years, impairment affected mainly verbal fluency; scores decreased an additional 16.10% and 16.60% in semantic and phonemic verbal fluency, respectively. 
Moderate decreases were observed in immediate recall (−16.87%), WAIS-III-LN (−16.67%), and JLO test (−11.56%).
Discussion
In our sample, DBS-SN did <scp><neg>not</neg> result in <dis>global cognitive impairment</dis> 5 years after surgery</scp>. 
<dis>Verbal function was found to be significantly impaired</dis> one year after the procedure. 
<dis>Impaired learning and visuospatial function</dis> may be attributed to degeneration associated with PD.Background
The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), an adaptation of the ACE cognitive screening test, has been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity in detecting <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in patients with <dis>dementia</dis> and other <dis>neurological and psychiatric disorders</dis>. 
Although the Spanish-language version of the ACE-III has already been validated in Spain, it is yet to be validated in Latin America. 
The aim of this study was to validate the ACE-III test in an Argentinean and Chilean population.
Methods
ACE-III was administered to 70 patients with Alzheimer disease, 31 patients with <dis>behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia</dis>, and a control group of 139 healthy volunteers. 
Participants were recruited at centres in both countries.
Results
The Spanish-language version of ACE-III was found to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.87). 
We found significant differences in total ACE-III scores between patients with Alzheimer disease and controls (p< .05) and between patients with Alzheimer disease and <dis>bvFTD</dis> (p< .05). 
With a cut-off point of 86, 98.6% of AD patients, 83.9% of <dis>behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia</dis> patients, and 84.2% of controls were correctly classified.
Conclusions
This study shows that the Spanish-language version of ACE-III continues to be an effective tool for detecting <dis>cognitive dysfunction</dis> in patients with <dis>dementia</dis>.Introduction
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by <dis>progressive dementia</dis> associated with <dis>global cognitive dysfunction</dis>.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating omega-3 supplementation in patients with AD.
Objective
To determine if there is scientific evidence of the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation in improving cognitive function in patients with AD.
Search strategy
We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following databases: Medline, Cochrane Central, Cinahl, and LILACS. 
An electronic search was also conducted using Google Scholar.
Study selection
Six articles met the eligibility criteria. 
The risk of bias was assessed following the Cochrane method.
Conclusion
There is no consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation in improving cognitive function in AD patients in the short and medium term.Abstract
 Objectives
To determine the pattern of services use and costs of patients requiring care for <dis>mental disorders</dis> (<dis>MD</dis>) in primary care in the context of routine clinical practice.
Methods
We performed a retrospective study of patients older than 15 consulting primary care at least once for <dis>MD</dis>, attended by 5 primary care teams in 2004.
A comparative group was formed with the remaining outpatients <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>MD</dis></scp>.
The main measurements were age, gender, case-mix/comorbidity and health resource utilization and corresponding outpatient costs (drugs, diagnostic tests and visits).
Multiple logistic regression analysis and ANCOVA models were applied.
Results
A total of 64,072 patients were assessed, of which 11,128 had some type of <dis>MD</dis> (17.4%; 95% CI, 16.7-18.1).
Patients consulting for <dis>MD</dis> had a greater number of health problems (6.7 vs. 4.7; p < 0.0001) and higher resource consumption, mainly all-type medical visits/patient/year (10.7 vs. 7.2; p < 0.0001).
The mean annual cost per patient was higher for patients with <dis>MD</dis> (851.5 vs. 519.2 euros; p < 0.0001), and this difference remained significant after adjusting by age, sex and comorbidities, with a differential cost of euros 72.7 (95% CI, 59.2-85.9).
All components of outpatient management costs were significantly higher in the <dis>MD</dis> group.
Conclusions
Outpatients seeking care for some type of <dis>MD</dis> had a high number of comorbidities and showed greater annual cost per patient in the primary care setting.Abstract
 Objectives
To quantify the use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in Spain on the basis of published reports, and to compare this use with that in other European countries.
Methods
We reviewed the scientific literature published by, or with the participation of, authors having Spanish institutional affiliations in Spanish or international journals between May 2001 and June 2010.
Results
A total of 47 papers were identified, with a recent annual increase in those published in English.
There was a predominance of theoretical journals (53.1%) and those specializing in mental health, rehabilitation and disability, with a medium or low impact factor.
The World Health Organization-Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-II) was used in 27.6% of publications.
Most studies addressed adult populations with <dis>mental illness</dis>.
Spain ranked midway in the table of European countries (fifth by Medline references).
Conclusions
This review suggests that the effective application of the ICF in Spain is limited but is increasing and is internationally co-ordinated.
The main fields of application are theoretical and diagnostic, in various clinical, rehabilitation and population-based contexts and, to a much lesser extent, in health services.Abstract
 Life expectancy for people with <dis>severe mental disorders</dis> is up to 25 years less in comparison to the general population, mainly due to diseases caused or worsened by smoking.
However, smoking is usually a neglected issue in mental healthcare settings.
The aim of this article is to describe a strategy to improve tobacco control in the hospital mental healthcare services of Catalonia (Spain).
To bridge this gap, the Catalan Network of Smoke-free Hospitals launched a nationwide bottom-up strategy in Catalonia in 2007.
The strategy relied on the creation of a working group of key professionals from various hospitals —the early adopters— based on Rogers’ theory of the Diffusion of Innovations.
In 2016, the working group is composed of professionals from 17 hospitals (70.8% of all hospitals in the region with mental health inpatient units).
Since 2007, tobacco control has improved in different areas such as increasing mental health professionals’ awareness of smoking, training professionals on smoking cessation interventions and achieving good compliance with the national smoking ban.
The working group has produced and disseminated various materials, including clinical practice and best practice guidelines, implemented smoking cessation programmes and organised seminars and training sessions on smoking cessation measures in patients with <dis>mental illnesses</dis>.
The next challenge is to ensure effective follow-up for smoking cessation after discharge.
While some areas of tobacco control within these services still require significant improvement, the aforementioned initiative promotes successful tobacco control in these settings.Summary
Despite the efficacy of lasar photocoagulation as the treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy, this condition is the leading cause of <dis>blindness</dis> in developed countries.
In this survey we have tried to find out whether this lack of effectiveness is due to a lack of adequate control and screening.
As a proxy measure for this we have developed an indicator called _“Lateness”_ and we have followed a sample of diabetics drawn from the two public hospitals in Vizcaya (Spain).
Seventy five percent of them were not at regular intervals and half of the sample was late for treatment.
Among these, Insulin dependent diabetics of older age and with more years of the disease are at a higher of entering late for treatment.
We could not find any riskfactor lateness among non insulin dependent diabetics.
We concluded that most of diabetics are not adequately followed up for the prevention of diabetic retinopalhy, and when they are referred to treatment it is too take the most advantage of it.Abstract
 The aim of this paper is to examine wheter preschool children with <dis>moderate Specific Language Impairment</dis> (<dis>SLI</dis>) exhibit impaired phonological representations in a task of serial recall of groups of nonsense and familiar words.
Results support explanations of <dis>SLI</dis> that attribute the disorder to <dis>problems in working memory</dis> particularly impairments in phonological representations.
Specifically, children with <dis>SLI</dis> performed more poorly than children <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>SLI</dis></scp> when processing of nonsense words and familiar words in initial position.
No such differences were observed between the groups when the task involved processing nonsense and familiar words in final position.
The above findings suggest that children with <dis>SLI</dis> devote more cognitive resources to the processing of items in final position because of <dis>capacity limitations in phonological working memory</dis>.
Theoretical and practical implications are discussedSeveral studies have pointed out the large number of <dis>dysarthria</dis> cases for people with acquired brain injury.
This <dis>motor speech disorder</dis> includes impairment of respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance or prosody.
A global evaluation method is necessary to assessment this complex disorder.
The few numbers of different types of test and instrumentation developed for Spanish speakers leads to a partial understanding of the disorder.
In order to get a deeper knowledgement of this pathology for Spanish speakers we review in this work the different evaluation procedures: clinic history, interview, perceptual analysis, acoustic analysis and instrumental assessment.
These procedures are of great interest since they will contribute to make a more accurate diagnosis and to improve the treatment objectives.<dis>Deafblindness</dis> is a unique disability characterized by <dis>multisensory deprivation of auditory and visual systems</dis>.
Most of <dis>deafblind</dis> patients have sensory residuary capacities that may become a fundamental tool in rehabilitation if they can be used as an advantage correctly.
We proposed auditory evoked potentials (AEP) as a useful alternative to identify objectively auditory residuary capacities in <dis>deafblind</dis> patients.
Six subjects (mean age: 13 years) with <dis>congenital deafblindness</dis>, brain damage and <dis>severe to profound hearing losses</dis> were included in this study.
All cases were evaluated (air conduction) with click auditory brainstem response (ABR) and multiple auditory steady state response (MSSR) as a combination of 4 carrier tones amplitude modulated (95 % depth) of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz.
Both AEP were recorded using the AUDIX system.
We have found residual hearing in all the patients even in those which no click ABR was recorded at the maximum stimulation levels.
The MSSR provides additional information about the contourand degree of the existing <dis>hearing impairment</dis>.
The lowest difference between ABR and MSSR mean thresholds was at 4 kHz, and the largest was at 0.5 kHz.
AEP are reliable techniques for objective evaluation of hearing in <dis>deafblind</dis> patients.
The MSSR evaluated more precisely the residual hearing and may provide a potential advantage over click ABR for the audiometric thresholds estimation in <dis>deafblind</dis> patients with <dis>severe or profound hearing losses</dis>.Nowadays in our society, the proportion of aged people among the general population is growing in such a way that it is thought that in the near future the sector of the population over 65 will undergo a significant rise.
This tendency will be particularly dramatic in the developed countries.
This aging of the population will give rise to a series of special needs in the health, psychological and social fields.
Furthermore there will be an increase in the incidence of dependence, especially in that arising from pathologies as <dis>dementia</dis> and Alzheimer disease.
This will have widespread repercussions throughout family and society.
In this respect we should bear in mind the great significance of an early detection of <dis>cognitive and language impairment</dis>.
Early detection and intervention will optimize the aging process and allow affected people to be treated as soon as possible, thus improving their quality of life.Donostia Longitudinal Study has investigated the effect of non-pharmacological interventions in older adults <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>, with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> and with <dis>dementia</dis>.
The current work is derived from this study and aims to go in depth into the linguistic profile of participants, as well as to perform a first empirical approximation to the effect of multi-type intervention in linguistic constructs.
We have had a sample of 395 subjects divided between stages from 1 to 4 of the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS).
There have been three groups for each stage: one of them followed an intervention established according to a pattern of decline by stages; the second performed stimulation tasks without any theoretical background and the third did not receive any kind of intervention.
The results showed a better performance in participants with GDS 1 and 2 compared to those with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Between GDS 3 and 4, differences were found in vocabulary, writing and semantic fluency, but not in listening comprehension, reading comprehension and phonological fluency.
Regarding to the effect of the intervention, an improvement is observed for those variables that measure lexical-phonological processes in those participants who do <scp><neg>not</neg> suffer <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>.Abstract
 Results of two studies are presented.
The aim of the first study has been the application of an instructional procedure, based on a top down hierarchy of instructional keys, to teach a boy with <dis>severe mental retardation</dis> to request access to a preferred item by means of a specific requesting and activating a cell of an augmentative and alternative communication device with voice output using a photograph as a symbol.
Ecological validity of the intervention was assessed.
In a second related study the effect of digitized voice output in the maintenance of requesting for the same boy was assessed.
Results for the first study showed that the instructional procedure for the substitution of prelinguistic communicative acts has been an effective one in order to teach the new symbolic communicative behaviour.
This symbolic communicative behaviour has been functionally equivalent to the prelinguistics acts the boy used to employ to request favourite items.
Generalization of the new learnt communicative behaviour was observed with different communicative partners and in varied settings.
In the second study, once the new symbolic communicative behaviour was taught and acquired by the boy, rates of requesting were compared across two conditions, speech output on versus speech output off, that were alternated on a session by session basis, and results showed that the new requesting behaviour was maintained regardless speech output.Abstract
 <dis>Communication disorders</dis> of children with <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis> will probably follow them throughout life if they are not included in remediation and communication intervention programs.
The aim of this research was to identify observed changes in the Functional Communicative Profile (initiative, interaction, functions and means) and in the Social Cognitive Performance (vocal and gestural communicative intent, vocal and gestural imitation, tool use, combinatory and symbolic play) after 6 months of language therapy.
Subjects were 50 children and adolescents (mean age 9:3y), with diagnosis within the <dis>autistic spectrum</dis> attributed by a child psychiatrist, enrolled in a specialized language therapy program at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
All subjects were filmed twice, with a six-month interval, after the first six-months of the therapy onset.
Statistical analysis of data used non- parametric tests with a significance level of 0.5%.
Results showed that all subjects presented at least one progress index and that 96% of them presented progress in the Functional Communicative Profile.
These results suggest that it is possible to identify objective improvement indexes after a relatively short period of language therapy with individuals of the <dis>autism spectrum</dis>.
Objective information about therapeutic results may favor better integration of intervention procedures and therefore enhance the possibilities of further improvements.Abstract
 Background and objectives
Residual hearing is considered a prognostic factor in patients with cochlear implants.
Objective determination of residual hearing by steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) is of the utmost importance.
The aims of this study were to quantify residual hearing and evaluate the usefulness of SSEP measurement in patients with cochlear implants.
Methods
Liminal pure-tone audiometry was applied in 12 patients before and after cochlear implantation.
SSEP were evaluated post-implantation.
Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations were carried out and contingency tables were constructed.
Results
Residual hearing at a frequency of 125 Hz was preserved in 37.5% of the patients, at 250 and 500 Hz in 45.45%, and at 1000 Hz in 27.27%.
After implantation, residual hearing at 2000 Hz was retained in 28.85%, at 4000 Hz in 16%, and at 8000 Hz in 0%.
Post-implantation SSEP showed no response in the implanted ear as compared with the non-implanted ear at frequencies of 500 and 1000 Hz.
Because the patients had <dis>bilateral profound hearing loss</dis>, this finding suggested partial destruction of the neural tissue in the implanted ear.
Conclusions
Residual low frequency hearing was preserved in most patients.
Our results suggest that SSEP is useful in the assessment of residual hearing.Abstract
 Introduction
Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disease characterized by <dis>motor, behavioral and cognitive disturbances</dis>.
<dis>Dysphagia</dis> is a common and life-threatening symptom of the disease leading to nutritional deficiencies and a high risk of bronchoaspiration.
Our objective was to study swallowing dysfunction and to present a specific intervention to improve or maintain swallowing efficiency.
Materials and methods
We recruited 10 ambulatory HD patients aged between 46 and 79 years old, with a moderate stage of the disease, who were compared with 10 age- and gender- matched healthy controls.
The safety and effectiveness of the oral and pharyngeal phases was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively through the volume-viscosity swallow test.
Results
We observed ineffective lip closure in 6 patients, oral residue in 4, repetitive swallows in 10, pharyngeal residue in 7, cough in 3, voice changes in 6, and a drop of 2 points in blood oxygen saturation in a further 3.
Controls scored between 60 and 63 points, while patients scored between 19 and 53 points.
Conclusions
The oral and pharyngeal swallowing phases are already compromised in moderate stages of HD.
We hypothesize that a specific rehabilitation program for <dis>dysphagia</dis> could improve <dis>swallowing difficulties</dis> and contribute to maintaining nutritional status in affected individuals.
Consequently, we propose a rehabilitation program including orolingual praxis and specific muscular postural strategies.Abstract
 <dis>Hearing loss</dis> is a significant problem for the elderly: It is the third most important chronic problem after hypertension and arthritis during ageing.
Screenings such as the hearing-dependent daily activities Scale –HDDA– were designed to be applied in non-hospital settings in order to detect possible hearing problems that have to be ratified through a complete audiological examination.
The aim of this paper is to present the results of a research study to test the effectiveness of the HDDA Scale as a tool for detecting <dis>hearing loss</dis> in a sample of 135 elderly people, considering that some of these people had <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>.
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> was explored using pure-tone audiometry and the HDDA Scale, as well as the presence of <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis> by Pfeiffer's questionnaire.
We conclude by showing that the HDDA Scale can be a useful tool to identify individuals with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, especially when their <dis>hearing loss</dis> is greater than 40 dB.
However, it is important to note that, in the case of people with <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>, we observed that their answers to the questionnaire are less reliable and tend to underestimate the potential problems posed by <dis>hearing loss</dis> in their everyday life.Summary
The on finishing their compulsory education (16-18 years) the <dis>prelocutive profoundly deaf</dis>, as a general rule, do not get over ther corresponding level of normal hearing 10 years olds.
Only a limited number of them can go on to higher studies.
So as to know the personal characteristics and the reading level of the really <dis>deaf</dis> who go on to higher studies, a group of 15 from different faculties of Valencia University has been examined, these suffer <dis>hearing losses</dis> of different tipes.
They have been compared to is normal hearing university students and to a group of 7 <dis>deaf</dis> people who wanted to get into university but were not able to.
The results show the educational success of the <dis>deaf</dis> university students needs a high level of reading comprehension, and confirms the narrow relationship that there is between knowing the oral language and the reading comprehension language.Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative process characterized by <dis>progressive cognitive deterioration</dis> and <dis>memory loss</dis>.
Although its etiology is unknown, several studies have demonstrated that the physiopathology of the disease shows numerous connections with lipoprotein metabolism.
Experimental studies and retrospective analyses of large cohorts indicate that statins could influence the natural history of the disease and reduce its incidence.
However, the results of clinical trials do not seem to support these findings and indicate that the beneficial effects of these drugs could be limited to delaying progression in subjects with already established disease.
Further studies specifically designed to evaluate this new effect are required.Abstract
 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent complication of diabetes and is one of the main causes of <dis>blindness</dis> in the population of working age in industrialized countries.
In the last few years, two studies (FIELD and ACCORD-EYE) have shown that fenofibrate is a therapeutic option in the early stages of DR.
In the FIELD study, a 30% reduction was found in the need for laser photocoagulation therapy in the group of patients treated with fenofibrate.
This beneficial effect was confirmed in the ACCORD-EYE study, which showed a 40% reduction in DR progression in patients treated with fenofibrate and simvastatin compared with those treated with simvastatin and placebo.
Despite the solidity of these clinical results, the mechanisms through which fenofibrate exerts a beneficial effect in DR remain unclear.
However, these effects have been related to its antioxidant and anti- inflammatory action, an antiapoptotic effect, its ability to preserve the function of the blood-retinal barrier, and possible neuroprotective and antiangiogenic effects.
Fenofibrate may also act through «non-classical» lipid mechanisms such as an increase in apoA1 or its ability to decrease small, dense LDL particles.
Knowledge of these mechanisms will provide a clearer perspective on the role of this drug in the management of DR and will also help to develop new therapeutic strategies to alleviate the devastating effects of this complication of diabetes.Abstract
 Traumatic brain injury is the first cause of death in persons younger than 45 years in Spain.
<dis>Swallowing disorders</dis> are common in the initial phase of a severe traumatic brain injury.
The incidence of <dis>dysphagia</dis> varies between 25 and 61% of patients and the prognosis depends on correct evaluation and early and appropriate treatment.
The outcome of <dis>dysphagia</dis> depends on a low score in the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale and the Glasgow Coma Scale, orotracheal intubation and the presence of tracheostomy.
The most widely used instrumental assessment tool for the diagnosis of <dis>dysphagia</dis> is videofluoroscopy.
This procedure consists of swallowing a variety of liquids and foods mixed with barium.

 Iodine deficiency is currently the most preventable cause of brain damage and <dis>mental retardation</dis> in both the fetus and neonate and of <dis>psychomotor impairment</dis> in young children.
According to the WHO and UNICEF, iodine deficiency affects some 2000 million people worldwide, representing onethird of the world population.
Limited consumption during pregnancy can also lead to lasting problems with maternal thyroid function after pregnancy.
The easiest and cheapest measure with the best results in preventing iodine deficiency is iodine prophylaxis using iodized salt.
To achieve this, an appropriate health policy is required that keeps the general population and, in particular, women of fertile age informed.
It is here that midwives, in their role as health advocates, acquire particular importance, as they are the health professionals most suited to impart health education in pregnancy.Abstract
 Objectives
To determine the outcomes of infants born at less than 29 weeks’ gestation, obstetric abnormalities, and the social and familial repercussions of this prematurity.
Material and methods
We retrospectively studied 28 infants, born at less than 29 weeks’ gestation, referred to the Early Healthcare Program of the Cantabrian Government between January 2002 and June 2006.
Results
The main causes of prematurity in this group were chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, and preterm labor.
Of the infants studied, 28.57% had a disability.
<dis>Severe mental retardation</dis> and <dis>cerebral palsy</dis> was found in 37% and <dis>moderate mental retardation</dis> in 24%.
<dis>Bilateral hypacusis</dis>, respiratory alterations and <dis>mild mental retardation</dis> were found in the remainder.
The main social repercussions were a change in family roles, negative economic effects, and heavy emotional burden.
Conclusions
A total of 28.57% of the infants studied had a recognized disability.
No predominant obstetric abnormality was identified.
However, the social and familial repercussions were substantial.The features of Wernicke's encephalopathy have been described as a combination of confusion, ocular abnormalities, and <dis>ataxia</dis>. 
Encephalopathy can complicate hyperemesis gravidarum because it impairs correct absorption of an adequate amount of thiamine and can cause electrolyte imbalance. 
We present the case of a 22-year-old primipara who was admitted to hospital due to lethargy, generalized weakness, ophthalmoplegia, <dis>language disturbance</dis>, and weight loss in her 12th week of pregnancy. 
The patient had a history of hyperemesis gravidarum three weeks before admission. 
Physical examination revealed a lethargic patient with horizontal nystagmus, <dis>ataxia</dis>, and symmetric hyporeflexia. 
Parenteral thiamine therapy was started. 
The patient recovered from the neurological deficits after 6 weeks of treatment.
Abstract
 Gastroesophageal reflux is a highly prevalent clinical entity consisting of the passage of gastric or duodenal contents into the esophagus in the absence of vomiting, belching, or any other situation that induces.
It is caused by an imbalance between esophageal defensive factors (antireflux barrier, esophageal clearance and tissue defense) and aggressive factors (the refluxed material, increased intragastric pressure and delayed emptying).
Heartburn and regurgitation are the main symptoms but also may be other as <dis>dysphagia</dis>, chronic cough, chest pain, otolaryngology pathology and asthma.
Clinical response to treatment with inhibitors of proton pump is a first step in the diagnostic process and may continue with the implementation of upper endoscopy and pH monitoring in selected cases.
The key to treatment are the proton pump inhibitors, having shown that descending patterns (high initial doses) are the most cost-effective.
Only a small percentage of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease need surgery and is usually limited to the occurrence of complications such as Barrett's esophagus, strictures and esophageal adenocarcinoma or failure of medical treatment.Abstract
 <dis>Dementia</dis> is a syndrome characterized by <dis>acquired cognitive deficit</dis>, or behavioral syntoms that interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities.
Its prevalence increases with age, and in those aged >65 years ranges between 5-14,9%, and progressive aging of the population predicts a significant increase in it.
Globally the most common cause is Alzheimer disease.
In addition to age, several genetic and environmental factors that increase the risk of developing <dis>dementia</dis>.
Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria.
The initial evaluation intends to detect <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, to determine the decline from previous levels of functioning and to rule out other entities that may present with cognitive complaints.
<dis>Dementia</dis> is usually divided into primary and secondary categories.
Ancillary tests are used to rule out the latter.Abstract
 Clinical case A patient with <dis>chronic, painless, bilateral loss of vision</dis>, after significant intake of interferon (IFNα) and ribavirina due to liver transplant.
Ocular fundus is normal.
A suspected retrobulbar optic neuropathy is confirmed by a prolongation of the latency of the patient's visual evoked potential.
There being no prior record of risk factors and with the patient's systemic analysis giving normal results, the clinical improvement and the electro-physiological tests conducted after the drug was withdrawn point to interferon as negatively affecting the bilateral optic nerve.
Discussion Interferon-α is used in the treatment of viral and neoplastic illnesses.
Currently the drug is formulated as Interferon alfa pegilado (IFNα-p) in order to reduce toxicity and increase tolerance.
The most common secondary effects are flu symptoms, asthenia and weigh loss.
Affected ocular tissue is rare and optic neuropathy is also an infrequent complication: retinopathy at the beginning of treatment is, however, more frequent.
The most widely accepted hypothesis as to the cause of toxicity is the presence of circulating immune complexes.
It is, therefore, essential for ophthalmologists to be aware of the toxicity of this drug in order to be able to withdraw it in good time, thus preventing potentially <dis>irreversible sight loss</dis>.Abstract
 Clinical case
The case is presented of 37 year-old male with a history of nasal obstruction with right rhinorrhea, headache, <dis>hearing loss</dis> and right exophthalmos of 4 months progression.
The MRI revealed that the ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses contained inflammatory tissue extending into the orbital region.
The biopsy confirmed a non-Hodgkin lymphoma of natural killer (NK) T cells.
Discussion
Non-Hodgkin's T NK lymphoma is a rare tumor in the orbital area that requires an early detection and multi-disciplinary care to ensure appropriate monitoring and treatment.Abstract
 Case report
We describe the case of a 35-year-old man who arrived in the Emergency Department with bilateral macular injury caused by accidental exposure to an industrial femtosecond laser.
Discussion
Workers operating industrial lasers must protect their eyes properly when handling these devices.
Otherwise, retina damage may occur which usually is recoverable.
However, sometimes this damage causes <dis>permanent visual loss</dis>.The definition of the negative response of the full field electroretinogram is the presence of a b-wave with less amplitude than the a-wave (b/a ratio<1) in the combined response of cones and rods. 
The presence of this pattern reflects an alteration in the bipolar cells, the Müller cells, or in the transmission of the stimulus from the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells, with preserved photoreceptor function.

This finding can be seen bilaterally and symmetrically in different hereditary conditions, such as <dis>congenital stationary night blindness</dis>, juvenile X-linked retinoschisis, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. 
On the other hand, it can also be found unilaterally (or asymmetrically) in acquired pathologies, such as some types of immuno-mediated retinitis (Birdshot retinochoroiditis), autoimmune retinopathies, cancer/melanoma associated retinopathy, or retinal toxicity.

The objective of this review is to summarise the characteristics of the pathologies in which this finding can be observed, in order to highlight its usefulness in the differential diagnosis of retinal conditions.
Introduction.
Tenofovir (TDF) is an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase nucleotide analogue, although it has good tolerability and high anti-retroviral activity, its effect on the kidney has been a concern.

Objective.
To describe a girl infected with HIV who presented Fanconi syndrome during antiretroviral therapy with TDF.

Clinical case.
We describe a HIV-1-infected girl, who after 18 months treatment with TDF presented loss of strength and pain of the lower extremities with <dis>functional impairment</dis>. 
Laboratory findings were consistent with Fanconi syndrome. 
Radiographs showed bilateral hip fracture and wrists. 
Full recovery of Fanconi syndrome was achieved four months after changing antiretroviral therapy.

Conclusions.
TDF-prescribing physicians must be prepared to detect signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction and immediately consider switching to another antiviral drug.
Introduction
Several US studies have investigated the criminal behaviour among homeless individuals with <dis>severe mental illness</dis>. 
But to date, no studies have been carried out in Spain.
Method
A retrospective observational study was conducted on a sample of 118 patients selected from a psychiatric care program for homeless individuals with <dis>severe mental illness</dis>. 
Factors associated with criminal behaviour were analysed by comparing 2 groups, with and without criminal records.
Results
Of the total sample studied, 24.6% had a criminal record, and 58.6% of them had entered prison. 
Significant differences between groups were found for the variables of gender, pending sentences, duration of homelessness, multiple substance use, disease awareness, and severity of psychotic symptoms.
Conclusions
In the population of homeless individuals with <dis>severe mental illness</dis>, regardless of gender, the co-existence of comorbidity with multiple substance use, and a prolonged duration of homelessness, is the most important risk factor for criminal behaviour.Summary
<dis>Eating disorders</dis> (<dis>ED</dis>) are significant <dis>mental health problems</dis> that primarily affect teenagers and young women.
Biological, psychological and social factors contribute to their etiology and treatment should consider this.
It must be done by interdisciplinary teams in which the experience of working with adolescents and specialization in <dis>eating disorders</dis> converge, issues that are essential for providing effective interventions.
The aim of the second part of this paper is the approach to treatment, medical complications, course and prognosis, and prevention in the clinical setting of <dis>ED</dis> in young people.
Summary
Neuromuscular Diseases constituted an heterogeneous group of disorders that can include motor neuron alterations, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular transmission and pathologies that affect the muscle itself.
Its progression varies considerably, presenting as various deficits that can vary from muscle weakness, <dis>sensory loss</dis>, pain, fatigue and <dis>autonomic dysfunction</dis>.
All of this can combine and result in musculoskeletal injury, causing limitations in daily living activities and restrictions in participation.
It is for this reason that in recent decades integrated rehabilitation programs have been created, conform by a multidisciplinary team, working in a coordinated manner, encompassing all factors that produce and increase disability, achieving the monitoring, prevention and the treatment of complications that can arise during the evolution of this group of diseases, with the goal of achieving the greater integration that their disease stage allows.   SUMMARY
Three clinical entities related with <dis>hearing loss</dis> are considered in “Sistema de Garantías Explícitas en Salud (GES)”, public health policies of the chilean government.
The following article makes a critical review of the clinical guidelines with special emphasis in issue to improve.    SUMMARY
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> presents a major health problem.
Patients with <dis>difficulty to hearing and communicating</dis> is frustrating for them causing social isolation and low self-esteem, often being associated with depression and <dis>dementia</dis> in senescence.
In health area there are very few developed technologies as quickly as Cochlear Implant.
In this editorial we will focus on the most important aspects such as technological innovation, extension of indications and surgical technique, and specially in education aspect and social impact.
Probably there are somes aspects to investigate, these sections collect the most important issues of the technique that has revolutionized not only in Otorhinolaryngology field, however the way to deal medical condition, social and communicative human problem.
   SUMMARY
While still most patients with <dis>hearing loss</dis> continue to benefit from conventional hearing aids, implantable hearing devices have rapidly evolved existing in the present a great variety of them.
Cochlear implants remain the most used and in which there is greater experience.
Implantable or semi Implantable bone conduction prosthesis changed the management of outer and middle ear atresia and malformations.
Despite how promising present and future is visualized with the use of these devices, we should always keep in mind that they require a surgical procedure for implantation and are not exent of complications, which should make us judiciously choose the prosthesis to be use.Abstract
 Otosclerosis is a common cause of <dis>progressive hearing loss</dis> in the young adult population.
Most of the time the diagnosis is suspected based on consistent clinical symptoms and physical examination.
The role of imaging in this pathology consists of confirmation of doubtful cases, ruling out by differential diagnoses, level of affection, and the pre-postoperative evaluation of patients.
High-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone is the imaging method of choice.   Summary
Xanthogranulomas of the choroids plexus (XG) are benign tumours of debatable etiology which become rarely symptomatic.
Only few cases have been studied with MRI.
A new case of xanthogranuloma of the third ventricle showing unusual features in the CT and MRI studies in a 47-year-old man with a 2-month history of <dis>gait and urinary disturbances</dis> and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> is reported.
The literature concerning clinical and neuroradiological presentation of intracranial xanthogranulomas is reviewed.Abstract
 Objective
To determine the prevalence of the main geriatric syndromes among people aged more than 70 years.
To identify positive aspects of the aging process and to relate them to autonomy and self-perceived health.
Method
Observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study.
Subjects.
People aged 70 years old or older attending the Gavarra Health Center (Cornellà de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain) or visited at home at least once a last year.
Sample size: 315 people, identified by systematic, randomized, stratified sampling.
Measurements: Geriatric syndromes: Urinary incontinence, polypharmacy, insomnia, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, <dis>mobility, and sensorial and emotional problems</dis>.
Instrumental and basic activities of daily living.
Self-perceived health.
Positive aspects of the ageing process: decision-making, previous satisfaction with life, feeling of usefulness, projects, and hobbies.
Information was gathered using the OMI-AP® program from June 2001 to December 2002.
Results
Of 315 individuals who were initially contacted, 283 (89%) were studied.
The main geriatric syndromes identified were: urinary incontinence (115; 41%), polypharmacy (109; 38%), and <dis>loss of vision</dis> (94; 33%).
The most important positive aspects of aging were: projects (266; 94%), decision-making (241; 85%) and feeling useful (232; 82%).
Self-perceived health was good in 164 individuals (58%) and poor in 82 (29%).
Conclusions
The prevalence of geriatric syndromes, mainly urinary incontinence, was high.
Factors associated with both instrumental and basic autonomy were the feeling of being useful, the ability to make decisions, and having projects and hobbies.
Having good self-perceived health involves other factors, which require further study.Abstract
 Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an exfoliative skin disorder that is associated with a high mortality rate.
Its pathophysiology is similar to that of superficial burn injuries.
Treatment and optimal care of these patients are best performed in Intensive Care Burn Units, with special attention to fluid resuscitation, respiratory support, early identification of sings of sepsis, and immunosuppresive therapy with cyclosporin A.
Approach to the treatment of TEN is multidisciplinary, and there is a central and fundamental role of nursing care, particularly in the identification of signs of hypovolemia, respiratory failure, infection and pain.
Among the specific care required by these patients is the care of mucosal surfaces, to prevent serious sequelae such as <dis>blindness</dis>.
Specialized nursing care of patients with TEN contributes to an increase in the survival rate and a decrease in the incidence of complications.Abstract
 Objective
To understand caregivers’ experience of rest.
Method
We performed a qualitative study guided by grounded theory procedures.
This study forms part of a wider study about burden relief in vulnerable situations.
Seventeen women family caregivers of patients with <dis>advanced dementia</dis> were purposely sampled.
Data were collected with 17 semi-structured interviews and were analyzed following grounded theory procedures.
Results
Caregivers did not rest as previously, with rest being incomplete and depending on the well-being of the sick relative.
In this study, tranquillity emerged as the central element of this new experience of rest.
Rest was perceived as an interpreted experience involving organizational and emotional effort.
Caregivers created and negotiated conditions that would provide the tranquillity to be able to rest.
Conclusions
The present study provides greater insight into the experience of relief from the burden of care and highlights the moral connotation present in family care.
Identifying how caregivers rest and what subjectively enables them to do so will not only help healthcare professionals to support and promote rest, but will also help to avoid blaming caregivers for not being able or wanting to rest.
Support services should bear in mind the change that has taken place in the experience of relief in caregivers’ lives.Abstract
 We present the case of a patient with long-term and clinically complex Diabetes Mellitus.
She was taking part in the home care program in Primary Care.
The complications of her DM affected her quality of life: <dis>blindness</dis>, kidney failure, treated with hemodialysis, and a cerebrovascular attack.
We describe the evaluation following Virginia's Henderson model.
This evaluation was made in the patient's home after she was discharged from the socio-health centre where she was admitted as her right leg was amputated at a supracondylar level.
It was designed a care plan between the community nurse and the case manager using NANDA, NOC and NIC taxonomy.
The care plan was carried out as a joint effort between the community nurse and the case manager who coordinated the planning with the rest of professionals.
Results were evaluated 6 months after the initial assessment.
This case, which had a high dependence and a high clinical complexity, required a multidisciplinary approach and the integration of different professionals, services and institutions to implement the patient's treatment.
Because of all the above, it is important to mention the case management function to guarantee continuity, and overall and integrated care.Abstract
 Objective
To identify the prevalence of the cardiovascular risk (RCV) in users with a <dis>Severe Mental Disorder</dis> (<dis>SMD</dis>) attended in mental health service in ParcTaulí (Sabadell - Barcelona).
Method
This is an observational, descriptive and transversal study of the factors of cardiovascular risk in 789 users with <dis>SMD</dis>.
The instrument used was the scale of assessment of the Registre Gironí del Cor, which estimates the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Results
26.6% of the sample has RCV (22.5% moderate, 3.8% high and 0.3% very high).
The analysis of the modifiable risk factors shows that 16.5% of the patients are hypertensive, 55.2% are smokers, 19.77% have hyperglycaemia (8.2% of whom are diagnosed of diabetes mellitus), 40.2% have obesity, 36.2% overweight and 47.27% hypercholesterolemia.
Conclusions
The study confirms that the prevalence of the RVC in <dis>SMD</dis> users is greater than the RCV in general population and it's associated to the presence of modifiable risk factors.
Health education carried out by nurses is the best to prevent the RCV in <dis>SMD</dis> users.Objectives
To describe the profile of patients evaluated by Nurse Care Management in an Emergency Department and identify the type of alternative healthcare resource assigned and report the results of clinical practice.
Material and methods
Prospective follow-up, on admission to the Emergency Department in an acute hospital and on discharge from the alternative healthcare resource, of patients assessed by Nurse Care Management, from July to December 2015. 
The patient characteristics, social environment and results of clinical practice were studied.
Results
190 patients were included of whom 13 were readmitted (6.8%). 
122 (59.8%) cases from the Emergency Department were referred to to intermediate care facilities, 71 (34.8%) cases for domiciliary care, 10 (4.9%) cases were referred to an acute care hospital and 1 (0.5%) died. 
Patients referred to intermediate care were more complex, presented geriatric syndromes as their reason for admission and diagnosed with <dis>dementia</dis>, while those referred to home care presented more respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (p <0.05). 
The mean Barthel Index and polypharmacy before emergency admission were higher than at the time of discharge from the alternative healthcare resource (p <0.05).
Conclusions
Patients presenting with advanced age, complexity, comorbidity, are referred to intermediate care facilities or domiciliary care, they are admitted to acute care hospitasl and are readmitted less than other patients. 
After being discharged from the alternative resource, they lose functional capacity and present less polypharmacy.Introduction
The stigma associated with <dis>mental illness</dis> is a health problem, discriminating and limiting the opportunities for sufferers. 
Social contact with people suffering a <dis>mental disorder</dis> is a strategy used to produce changes in population stereotypes. 
The aim of the study was to examine differences in the level of stigma in samples with social contact and the general population.
Method
The study included two experiments. 
The first (n=42) included players in an open football league who played in a team with players with schizophrenia. 
In the second included, a sample without known contact (n=62) and a sample with contact (n=100) were compared. 
The evaluation tool used was AQ-27, Spanish version (AQ-27-E). 
The mean difference between the two samples of each of the 9 subscales was analyzed.
Results
In the first experiment, all the subscales had lower scores in post-contact than in pre-contact, except for responsibility. 
The two subscales that showed significant differences were duress (t=6.057, p=.000) and Pity (t=3.661, p=.001).
In the second experiment, seven subscales showed a significance level (p=<.05). 
Segregation and responsibility and did not.
Conclusions
It is observed that the social contact made in daily situations can have a positive impact on the reduction of stigma. 
This can help to promote equality of opportunity.Pain management in <dis>advanced dementia</dis> is complex because of neurological deficits present in these patients, and nurses are directly responsible for providing interventions for the evaluation, management and relief of pain for people suffering from this health problem. 
In order to facilitate and help decision-makers, pain experts recommend the use of standardized protocols to guide pain management, but in Spain, comprehensive pain management protocols have not yet been developed for <dis>advanced dementia</dis>.
This article reflects the need for an integrated management of pain in <dis>advanced dementia</dis>. 
From the review and analysis of the most current and relevant studies in the literature, we performed an approximation of the scales for the determination of pain in these patients, with the observational scale PAINAD being the most recommended for the hospital setting. 
In addition, we provide an overview for comprehensive management of pain in <dis>advanced dementia</dis> through the conceptual framework «a hierarchy of pain assessment techniques by McCaffery and Pasero» for the development and implementation of standardized protocols, including a four-phase cyclical process (evaluation, planning/performance, revaluation and recording), which can facilitate the correct management of pain in these patients.Objective.
To evaluate the impact of a socio-educational intervention to improve the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia.

Method.
Out of 132 eligible candidates, 128 patients participated with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (ACR 1990/2010), over 18 years of age, who did <scp><neg>not</neg> have <dis>cognitive problems</dis> or <dis>mental disorders</dis> in acute phase</scp> and lived in the catchment area of the participating CAPs. 
The patients underwent intervention for 5 weeks to strengthen self-management of pain and improve quality of life. 
Socio-demographic variables, satisfaction and quality of life (SF-36) were studied. 
Pre-post measurements were made on the 128 participants and follow-up at 2 months on 120 (8 did not agree to be contacted).

Results.
Comparing the pre-post-intervention scores (non-parametric Wilcoxon test), it was found that 71.09% reported a higher perception of quality of life in the Mental health domain and lower percentage of improvement (28.91%) in the Physical role domain. 
When comparing pre-post-follow-up scores (Friedman's test), mean perception improved in all domains and remained at 2-month follow-up (P<.001). 
Finally, the average satisfaction with the intervention received was 90.55% (SD 9.86; min. 41, max. 100).

Conclusions.
When assessing the impact of the intervention, there was an improvement in the post and follow-up scores. 
This finding is largely due to the fact that the intervention strengthens the patient's self-mastery of their abilities to control pain and improve their perception of quality of life.
Background.
Saiatu is a programme that offers a specially trained in-home social welfare assistance to improve the delivery of care for people with advanced and terminal illness, and their families. 
The following is a presentation of a study carried out following 17 months of work, showing the characteristics of those patients cared for, the place of death, and facts relating to Saiatu's daily activity.

Method.
A cross-sectional, observational descriptive study was conducted in the region of Gipuzkoa.

Population of study: Patients cared for by Saiatu between 1 February 2011 and 30 June 2012.

Inclusion Criteria: Patients who had died before 30 June 2012.

Sample: The whole patient population (70 patients).

Variables and sources of information: Records of identification of patient and main carer, health care information, and date of admission into Saiatu.

Results.
Of the 70 patients cared for, 61.4% were men and 36.8% were women, with a mean age of 76.79 years old. 
In 62.9% of the cases the main carer was the spouse. 
More than half (60%) of the families did not have any public or private social support network, and their level of dependency was found to be severe to moderate in 75.7% of cases.

The large majority (88.6%) of the patients were oncological, and the remainder were non-oncological. 
The majority of cases, 37.1%, were referrals from hospitalisation at home.

Of the 92% who had expressed the wish to die at home, 71.4% had that wish fulfilled. 
However of those who died in hospital, 65% had expressed the wish to die at home. 
Overall 79% died in the place they had previously expressed.

It was observed that age, <dis>dysphagia</dis> and emotional concerns were associated with death at home, whilst anorexia was related to death in hospital.
Abstract
 Objective
To describe the socio-demographic and clinic characteristics and aspects related to information of non-oncological patients (NOP) with advanced disease, which are included in a palliative-home care support unit.
To identify the variables that could be associated with the death of NOP at home.
Material and method
A retrospective descriptive study was performed by reviewing the clinical histories of NOP attended by a Palliative-home Care Support Unit during the period from November 2009 to March 2013.
An analysis was performed on the socio-demographic and clinical data of the patients and their main caregivers, as well as the analysed, diagnostic and prognostic information provided by the family and the patient, preferences about end of life care of both parties, and the place of death.
The data analysis was performed with the computer pack SPSS® v. 21.
Results
Of the 371 clinical histories reviewed, 249 patients met the inclusion criteria.
The NOP represented the 36.19% of the activity, with a mean age of 81.4 years.
The most common disease was <dis>dementia</dis> (22.1%).
More than two-thirds (67.5%) of the patients came from Primary Care and residential homes for the elderly.
The main reason for referral was to control symptoms in 85.5%, with the most frequent being asthenia, dyspnoea, and pain.
A high comorbidity, geriatric symptoms, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was observed in 65%, and an <dis>important functional impairment</dis> (mean Barthel Index of 21.52, and Palliative Performance Scale score of 38.18).
The majority of main caregivers were women, and the patient's daughter, and the burden of caring was identified in 55.4%.
In the group <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>cognitive impairment</dis></scp>, the diagnosis was known by 83%, and 30% knew the prognosis.
Staying at home to receive end of life care was preferred by 95%, and 78% kept this preference for dying.
Two-thirds (66%) of all the patients died at home or in residential homes for the elderly.
The statistical analysis of the possible factors associated with dying at home showed a significant odds ratio when the patient lived in rural areas, and preferred home as the place of death.
Another factor is when the main caregiver does not suffer care burden and has a subjective perception of good health.
Conclusions
The predominance of NOP in end of life situations is characterised by advanced age, high comorbidity, increased symptomatic burden, significant overall <dis>functional impairment</dis> on admission, and high mortality.
More than the half of the caregivers showed excessive burden of caring.
In conclusion, they are patients with similar needs to those with advanced oncological disease.
The high prevalence of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> suggested that only half of the patients were able to participate in the information and in the advanced care planning.Objective
to Analyze the characteristics of patients with <dis>dementia</dis> attended by a home care support team and to establish whether there are differences from patients with other diseases.
Material and methods
A prospective, comparative analytical study of 2 cohorts of patients attended at home, one with <dis>dementia</dis> and one without, comparing age, sex, principal caregiver, number of visits and time of follow-up, reason for discharge, medical comorbidity, Barthel index prior to intervention and on the first home care support team visit, Pfeiffer questionnaire, type of dementia and Global Deterioration Scale of Reisberg, amount of previous medication, presence of symptoms (pain, dyspnoea, nausea, anxiety, depression, insomnia, agitation) treatment of symptoms or modification of previous treatment, need for sedation. 
Data analysis with SPSS 15.0 software.
Results
Of all patients attended (N=638), 195 comprised the cohort of patients with <dis>dementia</dis> (30.7%). 
The most common cause was <dis>vascular dementia</dis> 40.4% (N=74). 
The average Global Deterioration Scale was 6±1.05, with an average score of 8.87 errors in the Pfeiffer test and average Barthel index of 11.9± 23. 
In the patients <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>dementia</dis></scp>, significant differences were obtained in terms of functional and cognitive status (Barthel index of 52.34±38 and Pfeiffer test with an average score of 1.48 ±3.2 (P<.001)). 
The patients with <dis>dementia</dis>, most commonly institutionalised (37.9% versus 11.8% in non-demented), presented a greater amount of immobility syndrome (70.3% versus 24%) and pressure ulcers (19.6% compared to 3.9%), fewer symptoms other than agitation and less need for palliative sedation (8.2% versus 20.4%). 
These are patients with lower mortality 31.8% versus 53.1%) and a reduced need for hospitalisation (6.7% versus 17.5%), with no differences in clinical activity.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that these patients have a slowly progressive symptomatic and functional profile that will require attention at times of crisis, hospital admissions could be reduced by adequate control of symptoms.Objective
To describe how relatives of patients admitted to nursing homes qualify death and determine which factors influence this qualification.
Method
A descriptive and retrospective study. 
A questionnaire was sent to 52 relatives of deceased patients of 8 nursing homes. 
The Good Death Inventory (GDI) and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were used to assess different aspects of patient death; in addition open questions on aspects of end of life decisions were included. 
Non-parametric tests were performed to check for differences between the qualification of sociodemographic and clinical variables, physical symptoms, decision making and quality of end of life.
Results
34 relatives 34 families responded to the questionnaire. 
67.6% women with an average age of 57.03 years (SD=12.35). 
Most of the deceased patients were women (61.8%) with a mean age of 86 years (SD=7,23). 
The most severe symptom in the last days of life was depression (m=7.75, SD=2.44). 
Being respected as an individual“was the dimension that scored best (m=6.01; SD=1.56), and”Independence“worst (m=1.72; SD=1.28). 
Relatives of patients with <dis>dementia</dis> reported a lower percentage of a good death (23.1% vs. 61.1%, P=.00) than the rest. 
The dimensions”physical and psychological comfort“(P=.00),”Show Hope and pleasure“(P=.03) and”Feeling that their life is worth living“(P=.01) scored higher in cases which reported a good death.
Discussion
Almost half of the relatives of patients who died in nursing homes reported a good quality of death. 
Aspects such as human respect and intimacy were highly rated. 
<dis>Dementia</dis> is a factor that might be considered in further studies.Involuntary outpatient treatment is believed to increase adherence, thereby preventing deterioration and harm to people with <dis>severe mental illness</dis> or to others.
Involuntary treatment remains controversial.
In addition to arguments for and against the introduction of involuntary outpatient treatment, the results of published studies are contradictory.
Most observational studies report patient improvement, although methodological limitations cast doubt on these results.
Two randomized studies suggest that outpatient commitment is only effective when linked to the provision of intensive community services.
In this article we review this topic, including the current situation in Spain.Because pain is the earliest and most common symptom of morbidity through which people perceive the presence of disease, it is the most frequent cause of medical consultations.
Pain poses manifold problems in all fields of medicine and psychiatry.
Chronic pain has several etiologies such as <dis>psychological and psychiatric disorders</dis>.Diogenes syndrome is a <dis>behavioural disorder</dis> of the elderly.
Symptoms include social isolation, domestic squalor, hoarding rubbish, self-neglect, and refusing external help.
According to the literature, approximately half of the patients with this syndrome have a <dis>mental disorder</dis>.
We report 3 cases of Diogenes syndrome representing 3 different clinical forms: the primary type, associated with a <dis>personality disorder</dis>, the secondary type due to <dis>dementia</dis>, and the secondary type associated with different <dis>mental disorders</dis> (e.g., schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol dependence).We present and review a case of evident comorbidity, not only psychiatric but also neurologic and substance abuse disorder, in an adult patient with <dis>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</dis>.Abstract
 Mitochondrial cytopathies are unusual diseases of which there are more than 50 variations.
Their common pathophysiology involves a mitochondrial energy metabolism malfunction.
Muscular and brain tissue are particularly affected due to their high oxidative metabolism, hence they are usually identified as «encephalomyopathies».
Case report
A 28 year old woman, who, at the age of 20, presented with a <dis>gait disorder</dis> and drooping upper eye-lid, was diagnosed with Kearns-Sayre syndrome.
After an anxious-depressive episode, she was followed up in the Outpatients of a Mental Health Centre with psychiatric and psychological treatment.
Methods
Neuropsychological assessments were made to explore the cognitive state.
We applied the Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), the Revised Barcelona Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting.
Results
<dis>General cognitive impairment</dis> was found in all the tests administered.
<dis>Specific cognitive impairments</dis> were also found which fitted in with those found in previous studies.
Discussion
This case report emphasizes the increasing importance of neuropsychological assessment in neurological syndromes with <dis>cognitive impairments</dis> and <dis>psychiatric disturbances</dis>.
It allows us to objectify the overall level of <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and to establish a correlation between the deficits and the brain areas involved.
The neuropsychological profile is very useful in future rehabilitation programs, focusing on stimulation and recovery of the affected cognitive areas.
We discussed also her relationship with mood disorders.Abstract
 A 31 years old patient with <dis>mental retardation</dis> develops complete parkinsonism while treated with 300 mg/day of quetiapine and metronidazole.
As associated factor, we find an idiosyncratic sensitivity to antipsychotics.Abstract
Background
Corpus callosum (CC) size has been associated with <dis>cognitive and emotional deficits</dis> in a range of <dis>neuropsychiatric and mood disorders</dis>.
As such deficits are also found in suicidal behavior, we investigated specifically the association between CC atrophy and suicidal behavior.
Methods
We studied 435 right-handed individuals <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>dementia</dis></scp> from a cohort of community-dwelling persons aged 65 years and over (the ESPRIT study).
They were divided in three groups: suicide attempters (n = 21), affective control subjects (AC) (n = 180) without history of suicide attempt but with a history of depression, and healthy control subjects (HC) (n = 234).
T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were traced to measure the midsagittal areas of the anterior, mid, and posterior CC.
Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to compare CC areas in the 3 groups.
Results
Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, gender, childhood trauma, head trauma, and total brain volume showed that the area of the posterior third of CC was significantly smaller in suicide attempters than in AC ( _P_ = .020) and HC ( _P_ = .010) individuals.
No significant differences were found between AC and HC.
No differences were found for the anterior and mid thirds of the CC.
Conclusions
Our findings emphasize a reduced size of the posterior third of the CC in subjects with a history of suicide, suggesting a diminished interhemispheric connectivity and a possible role of CC in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior.
Further studies are needed to strengthen these results and clarify the underlying cellular changes leading to these morphometric differences.
Abstract
 Fahr disease is a syndrome of unknown etiology, consisting of bilateral idiopathic calcifications of basal ganglia and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
We describe the case of a 70 year old man with no psychiatric background, admitted to the hospital due to the presence of depressive symptoms with economic and guilt delusions and suicidal idea.
He suffered a depression 3 years ago that completely resolved with mirtazapine, and calcifications of basal ganglia were a casual finding in the CT.
In the current hospital admission, the lack of efficacy of antidepressant, antipsychotic and anxiolytic treatment lead to a severe melancholy stupor that indicated electroconvulsive therapy, which controlled both the psychotic and affective symptoms, but a <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> state was observed once the psychiatric symptoms resolved.Abstract
 Antipsychotic drugs are widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder due to their mood stabilizing, antimanic and antidepressant properties.
Bipolar disorder has a high rate of comorbidity with other <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis>, in particular anxiety disorders, substance abuse, <dis>eating disorders</dis>, <dis>personality disorders</dis> and <dis>attention deficit disorder</dis> and <dis>hyperactivity</dis>.
In this paper, a summary is provided of the various studies assessing antipsychotic efficacy when bipolar disorder presents another <dis>comorbid psychiatric disorder</dis>.
In general, these drugs have proved useful for anxiety disorders (in particular generalized anxiety disorder), alcohol consumption and <dis>borderline personality disorder</dis>.
Drugs that have been studied more commonly within this population include olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole.
This work is intended as a guide for clinicians, to provide stronger evidence for the antipsychotic in question at the time of treating comorbid bipolar disorder.A substantial percentage of primary care (PC) visits are motivated by some type of <dis>emotional disorder</dis>, especially depression, anxiety and somatization. 
These common <dis>mental disorders</dis> represent a significant burden for the people affected and for the society. 
Despite the availability of effective psychological therapies for these disorders, psychological interventions are rarely used in PC. 
The aim of the Psychology in Primary Care (PsicAP) project is to demonstrate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural group therapy to treat the most prevalent emotional disorders in PC. 
This therapy, which involves only 7 sessions, is especially appropriate for PC settings. 
In the present article, we present the treatment manual, session by session, with extracts that illustrate key contents of the sessions. 
Finally, we discuss the implications of a protocol of this type at a time when clinical psychologists and clinical psychology interns are starting to be integrated into the PC setting in Spain.
Abstract
 A 45 year-old woman, right handed, with no medical history of interest, and a good level of education was seen in the clinic due to subjective complaints of memory and <dis>language problems</dis>.
She was diagnosed with <dis>primary progressive aphasia</dis> (<dis>PPA</dis>) three years ago and had received speech therapy for a year.
The psychopathological examination was normal, with <dis>categorical verbal fluency impairment</dis>, although with good comprehension and speaking ability, normal praxis and normal performance in the cognitive screening test.
The subjective complains of memory were assessed by test of verbal memory.
Furthermore, behaviour changes, particularly irritability, were reported by family.
These problems did not affect her activities of daily living.
The present case shows the difficulties in classifying cases into different subtypes of <dis>PPA</dis> and the problems in making a possible prognosis.Abstract
 To assess the functional hearing ability of a small child with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, it is necessary to resort to different indirect tests that can reflect the information being provided by hearing aids, or by exploring what the child is doing with this acoustic information, mainly as regards the abilities in the acquisition and development of language.
From the results of this assessment, it can be determined if the adjustment is the best that this child can achieve at that time, or if modifications need to be made to optimise it and thus achieve the best intelligibility of speech in a variety of communication environments and situations.Abstract
 The audiology is a discipline that since its inception has sought in technology resources to address <dis>communication problems</dis> resulting from <dis>hearing disorders</dis>.
Among the different possibilities that enhance auditory perception, cochlear implants are an important milestone as it is indicated in the <dis>bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss</dis> involving major problem for human communication.
Currently, the widespread use of cochlear implants can raise new perspectives in the study of <dis>hearing and communication disorders</dis> associated with this loss.
The voice is one of the aspects of communication that are most altered in relation to the degree of <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Although there are many studies that relate speech and hearing, yet little literature studying this relationship in adult patients with cochlear implants.
The aim of this paper is to raise this ratio in patients with <dis>post-lingual profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis> that after undergoing cochlear implant surgery are able to reflect through a subjective assessment by the Voice Handicap Index an evolution in the perception of their own voice.
The results regarding the perception of voice before and after cochlear implant by study subjects correlated with the publications to date and reflect a subjective improvement in this perception.Abstract
 Background
Subjects with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
As intellectual ability is lower in DS subjects than among the general population, it is difficult to determine whether cognition has deteriorated with age to the point of fulfilling AD diagnostic criteria.
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) are standard cognitive tests widely used to assess <dis>dementia</dis> in the general population.
There are few studies using the MMSE and the SIB on subjects with DS where <dis>dementia</dis> is suspected.
The aim of the present study was to analyse the appropriateness of the SIB and the MMSE in the cognitive assessment of aging subjects with DS.
Methods
The SIB and the MMSE were administered to 45 subjects with DS (16 with Alzheimer's disease and 29 <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>dementia</dis></scp>), and the DMR questionnaire was given to their caregivers.
Results
DS subjects with <dis>dementia</dis> had higher impairment levels than DS subjects <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>dementia</dis></scp> in their social and total DMR scores, but no significant differences were found between the two groups in the SIB and MMSE scores or in cognitive DMR performance.
Overall, SIB scores correlated significantly with MMSE results, total DMR, cognitive DMR, and social DMR.
MMSE performance correlated significantly with total and cognitive DMR scores as well as SIB score.
Conclusion
The SIB and the MMSE are useful assessment tools in monitoring cognitive function among subjects with DS and <dis>cognitive loss</dis> or <dis>dementia</dis>.Abstract
 Children with Down Syndrome (DS) are children who grow and have interests, desires and needs just like any other child in their age group.
Although <dis>mental retardation</dis> (<dis>MR</dis>) does give rise to certain syndrome-specific characteristics in their language development, these must not be treated in isolation because they have a bearing on other global development acquisitions.
This paper advocates that we consider the importance of interaction and communication in early language acquisition from a functional perspective, bearing in mind the complexity of the language system and the interconnections between cognitive, emotional and social aspects in the acquisition process, in addition to the specificities of children with DS in their overall development.
As the focus in this case is early childhood, rather than working directly with the child the proposed intervention seeks to help parents find communicative strategies that enhance the interactions they have with their children.Abstract
 Like anyone else, people with Down syndrome can suffer <dis>mental health problems</dis> that require diagnosis, treatment and prevention.
The higher number of depressions seen in recent years is a cause for concern and must be taken on by health professionals and families.
Depression is difficult to diagnose in people with Down syndrome as its symptoms can be mistaken with those of other conditions.
This paper sets out to define depression, highlight the specific manifestation of symptoms and give guidelines on how it can be diagnosed and treated.
Importance is also placed on prevention.Abstract
 People with a <dis>learning disability</dis> are living longer.
This increased longevity brings with it the conditions of older age including <dis>dementia</dis>.
Amongst people in the general population who have <dis>dementia</dis> there is inadequate pain recognition and treatment.
Limited research has been undertaken on the pain management needs of people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who have <dis>dementia</dis>, yet they will experience high levels of physical health needs that will, as a consequence, result in pain.
The research study ‘Responding to the Pain needs of People with a Learning Disability and Dementia’ explored the detection, management and understanding of pain amongst a range of professional groups involved in supporting people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who have <dis>dementia</dis>.
The study also recorded the experiences and views of some people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who had <dis>dementia</dis>.
The dilemmas and obstacles to effective pain management were explored.
It was found that the pain experiences and management of people with a <dis>learning disability</dis> who have <dis>dementia</dis> mirrored findings in the general population.
The research did, however, identify extra and compounding issues in relation to people with a <dis>learning disability</dis>.
Drawing on this research this article outlines recommendations for practitioners and service providers and discusses the key lessons for responding more effectively to pain in people with Down’s syndrome and <dis>dementia</dis>.
Objective
.
Analyze the mortality of the Gandhi functional zone (GFZ) to identify Public Health problems that can be improved from Primary Health Care.
Methods
.
Descriptive study of mortality during the year 1998 in a functional zone of the Health Care Area 4 in the Madrid Community (MC) with a total population of 35,636 persons.
The mortality rates have been standardized by the indirect method for large groups according to the ICD-9 and according to specific causes, taking the MC population of the year 1998 as reference.
Results
.
Globally, the GFZ presents the same mortality rate adjusted by age as the MC; however, by large groups of causes, in the GFZ, there is an overmortality in tumors (11%), digestive tract diseases (24%), <dis>mental disorders</dis> (15%) endocrine-immunological diseases (27%) and infectious diseases (60%).
In men, mortality due to COLD and lung cancer is 53% and 36% greater in the GFZ than in the MC, respectively.
In women, mortality due to diabetes is 62% greater than in the MC and due to <dis>dementia</dis> 30% greater.
Conclusions
.
The analysis of mortality in small population nuclei may contribute to detecting health problems that require the action of the Primary Health Care professionals.
For the GFZ, control of smoking in males may be the main factor to keep in mind to decrease mortality.Objectives
Measure the prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric syndrome (PMDS) by heteroadministered survey with diagnostic criteria of the American Association of Psychiatry (AAP) present in the DSM-IV.
Methods
An observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study was designed with location in the Basic Health Area (BHA) of Porzuna (Ciudad Real).
Scope: primary health care; rural setting.
Target population: all women between 18 and 50 years of age from the BHA (948).
A total of 226 were selected by simple random sampling, with automatic and consecutive replacement of those who refused to participate (8).
Of these, 21 could not be located or fulfilled exclusion criteria: menopause, gestation, <dis>mental retardation</dis> (11), 186 women finally participating in the study.
These women were administered a heteroadministered survey, collecting information regarding the AAP criteria for the diagnosis of PMDS during the last year and sociodemographic, comorbidity and pharmacological treatment data.
Results
A total of 84.33% of those surveyed had some type of premenstrual discomfort, these being moderate (at least one symptom during all or most of the cycles of the last year) in 69.73% and intense (5 or more symptoms in most of the cycles but without affecting work, social or family life) in 8.11% Prevalence of PMDS found according to AAP criteria is 6.49% (n = 12; 95% CI: 2.95 - 10.03%).
Conclusions
Prevalence of PMDS found in our population agrees with the data published in international studies (2.5 - 14%) and moves away from the prevalences published in our country (20.6 - 28.6%) with self-applied surveys.Abstract
 A 36 year-old woman, with mechanical neck and left shoulder pain radiating to the arm, 4th and 5th fingers of the left hand, with a chronic and modest loss of strength and sensitivity.
<scp><neg>No</neg> <dis>loss of hearing</dis></scp>; no urinary or cardiological symptoms.
Physical Examination: Ears, hair implantation and neck length normal.
Pain on palpation of vertebral spine apophyses and neck muscles.
A decrease in tactile sensitivity and painful in the left hand cubital area, 4th and 5th fingers.
Rx Spinal Column: Fusion of vertebrae C3-C4 y C7-D1.
NMR Spinal Column: Fusion of vertebrae C2-C3 y T1-T2.
EMG: signs of median nerve trapping in Carpal Tunnel.
Diagnosis: Klippel-Feil Syndrome.
Klippel-Feil Syndrome is a rare congenital disease of the group of craniocervical hinge malformation, which consists of the fusion of two or more vertebrae.
It is occasionally associated with genitourinary system, nerve, cardiopulmonary defects and <dis>hearing loss</dis>.Abstract
 <dis>Cognitive impairment</dis> is becoming increasingly more common in primary care, and not all is due to Alzheimer's disease or <dis>Vascular Dementia</dis>.
Other diagnostic possibilities, such as normotensive hydrocephalus or chronic adult hydrocephalus also have very similar signs.
A clinical case of normotensive hydrocephalus is presented, a condition that is characterised by a typical triad: <dis>Gait disturbance</dis>, <dis>dementia</dis> and urinary incontinence.Abstract
 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is considered the most common cause of <dis>blindness</dis> in the working-age population in industrialised countries, with diabetic macular oedema being the most common reason of decreased visual acuity in diabetics.
According to the results of large multicentre studies, <dis>blindness</dis> prevention for RD involves conducting periodic check-ups, which include examinations of the back of the eye, so they can be treated in time.
The use of non-mydriatic cameras and telemedicine have been shown to be useful in this regard (sensitivity > 80% and specificity > 90%).
If this procedure is followed, the first retinography should be performed 5 years from diagnosis in type 1 diabetics and immediately after diagnosis in type 2 diabetics.
Therefore the role of the Primary Care physician is crucial to enable early diagnosis of this disease.Despite its high prevalence, <dis>mental disorders</dis> are often underdiagnosed.

Objective.
To determine the magnitude of the underdiagnosis <dis>mental disorders</dis> and its associated characteristics.

Methodology.
A descriptive cross-sectional study performed in Lanzarote (2011) on 310 patients selected by cluster random sampling. 
A self-completed questionnaire was used that contained the General Health Questionnaire-28, as well as structured interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to confirm the diagnosis of <dis>mental disorder</dis>. 
The current diagnosis registered in the DRAGO-AP electronic medical record was also recorded.

Results.
Of the 75 patients detected with the interview, 14 (18.67%) had a diagnosis recorded in the medical record (sensitivity=0.19; IC 95% CI; 0.09-28). 
The positive predictive value of being in the medical record was 0.56.

With respect to sensitivity, only the “number of visits made to the health centre in the last 3 months” was significantly higher in the group of patients also with a diagnosis of any <dis>mental disorder</dis> in the medical record (5 vs. 2.77; p=.002).

Conclusions.
There is an important underdiagnosis of the <dis>mental disorders</dis> in our environment. 
More visits to the health centre are associated with this diagnosis.
Introduction
<dis>Oropharyngeal dysphagia</dis> is one of the lesser known geriatric syndromes, despite its enormous impact on functional capacity, quality of life, and health of those affected.
Material and methods
A descriptive and prospective study was conducted by the Geriatric Department of Barbastro Hospital (Huesca), from March 2012 to October 2014, as biannual and annual reviews in October 2015. 
This study included all patients on whom a volume-viscosity clinical examination (MECV-V test) was performed to suspecting <dis>dysphagia</dis>.
Results
The study included 266 patients with a mean age of 82.35±12.3 years, and with a mean Barthel index score of 20.5±25.4, and mean Charlson index of 1.77±1.6. 
The test was performed in 105 cases after stroke (40%), 53 in <dis>dementia</dis> (20%), 24 in Parkinsonism (9%), and for other different reasons in 80 (31%). 
<dis>Dysphagia</dis> was diagnosed in 228 (86%) cases. 
Enteral nutrition was given in 25 (10.9%) cases. 
The test results were shown in the discharge report in 45% of the tests with positive result. 
The mean survival obtained after test in the patients who died was 230.8±256.5 days. 
Differences in survival at 12 months were found in patients with positive test, without finding a clear relationship with functional status and comorbidity.
Conclusions
<dis>Dysphagia</dis> has a significant mortality, and the use of thickeners after its detection should be properly reported.The purpose of this work is to present the approach to <dis>mental disorders</dis> in Moroccan patients from a sociocultural perspective. 
The anthropology of health and ethno-psychiatry will allow us to analyze the concepts of health and disease. 
From the Moroccan cosmovision we will analyze the alternative treatments and their association with other therapeutic models.Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder with features that change with age.
In infancy, PWS is characterized by hypotonia, <dis>feeding difficulties</dis>, <dis>developmental delay</dis>, and genital hypoplasia.
In adolescence and adulthood, problems are centered on <dis>behavioral disorders</dis>, absence of satiety, and <dis>mild to moderate mental retardation</dis>.
In the past two decades remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of its clinical manifestations and natural history, and treatments have been developed, such as growth hormone therapy and the use of psychoactive drugs, which can improve quality of life in these patients.
However, knowledge about the management of PWS in adulthood is still poor.
This article aims to provide an overall view of the most important clinical problems in adults with PWS.
The issues included are obesity and its consequences, cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes, respiratory abnormalities, <dis>sleep disorders</dis>, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and <dis>behavioral and psychiatric disorders</dis>.Iodine is an essential micronutrient without which the thyroid is unable to synthesize and secrete its two iodine-containing hormones, tetra-iodo- thyronine or thyroxine (T4) and 3’, 3, 5-tri-iodothyronine (T3), containing, respectively, 4 and 3 iodine atoms per molecule.
Both hormones are needed throughout life, with T4 being especially important for the development of the cerebral cortex as early as during the first trimester of pregnancy.
The need for adequate iodine intake is recognized among the Rights of the Child, since, after starvation, iodine deficiency is the most frequent nutritional cause worldwide of preventable <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
The present article discusses several questions: are T4 and T3 equivalent for the developing brain?
What happens to T4 during iodine deficiency?
What changes are imposed on maternal thyroid function by the fetus?
What happens when a pregnant woman is iodine deficient?
What effect does breast feeding have on iodine status?
The answers to the above questions explain why iodine requirements are doubled from the very onset of pregnancy.
Even in conditions of mild-moderate iodine deficiency, which still prevail throughout Spain, daily supplementation of at least 200 μg iodine is required to prevent mental retardation, starting, if possible, before the onset of pregnancy and continuing until the end of breast feeding.Iodine is a trace element essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones.
Iodine deficiency is especially worrying in neonates, who must synthesize sufficient thyroid hormones to meet their hormonal requirements, since formula preparations for premature and term infants do not always contain adequate iodine.
Worldwide, the main cause of hypothyroxinemia is iodine deficiency, which in turn is the main preventible cause of <dis>mental retardation</dis> and <dis>cerebral palsy</dis>.Abstract
 Many skin diseases are associated with <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
When the psychological symptoms are mild, as is often the case in dermatology, it can be difficult to distinguish between normality and the manifestations of a <dis>mental disorder</dis>.
To facilitate the distinction we review the concept of <dis>mental disorder</dis> in the present article.
It is also important to have instruments that can facilitate early detection of <dis>psychological disease</dis>, i.e. when the symptoms are still mild.
Short, simple, self-administered questionnaires have been developed to help dermatologists and other health professionals identify the presence of a <dis>mental disorder</dis> with a high degree of certainty.
In this article, we focus on the questionnaires most often used to detect the 2 most common <dis>mental disorders</dis>: anxiety and depression.
Finally, we describe the circumstances in which it is advisable to refer a dermatological patient to a psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat the <dis>mental disorder</dis> in accordance with standard protocols.
Objective
To describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features and prognostic indicators of pneumococcal meningitis in children admitted to a children's hospital in Madrid.
Patients and method
We retrospectively studied 28 children with a diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis based on identification of S. pneumoniae in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid between 1990 and 1999.
None of the children had previous immunological deficit or had received antipneumococ-cal vaccine.
Results
The mean age of patients was 2.7 ± 2.9 years (range: 2 months to 11 years).
Eighty-two percent of the children were younger than 5 years old.
Male to female ratio was 1:1.
The most frequent signs on admission were fever (100%), vomiting (57%), headache and irritability (53%), and shock (10%).
Neurologic findings were lowered level of consciousness in 22 patients (mean Glasgow Coma Scale score 9.9 ± 3.9); seizures in 15 (53%); neck stiffness in 12 patients (42%) and arreactive mydriasis in 9 patients (32%).
Twenty patients (71%) required admission to the intensive care unit.
On discharge 15 patients (53%) had no sequelae; 8 patients (28%) suffered <dis>deafness</dis>; 4 (14%) had <dis>hemiparesis</dis>; 2 (7%) had severe hydrocephalus and 1 patient (3.5%) had <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
Four patients (14%) died.
Findings with the strongest predictive value for death or <dis>deafness</dis> (p > 0.05) were coma and alterations in cranial computer tomography (CT).
Seizures, alterations in electroencephalogram (EEG) and hypogly-corrhachia were also prognostic indicators for <dis>deafness</dis> (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children.
<dis>Deafness</dis> is one of the most common and serious sequelae of pneu-mococcal meningitis.
Sequelae were asociated with coma, alterations in CT scan, seizures and hypoglycorrhachia.
The new, antipneumococcal conjugated vaccine will confer effective prevention from the age of 2 months and will produce a dramatic decrease in the incidence of this serious infection.Objectives
To describe the implementation of a program for the early detection of <dis>deafness</dis> in newborn infants in a private hospital.
Materials and methods
Between August 1, 1994 and July 31, 1999, 1,750 neonates from the nursery and neonatology unit of our hospital were studied using evoked acoustic emissions (EAE).
Screening was performed after the first 24 hours of life and after parent consent had been obtained.
Results
The coverage (number of neonates screened using otoa-coustic emissions compared with the total number of live births) increased from 6% in 1994 to 37.5% in 1999.
Six <dis>mild-moderate neurosensory hypoacusis</dis> were detected; overall results were 4 % <dis>hypoacusis</dis> and 2.3 % <dis>bilateral hy-poacusis</dis>.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that <dis>hardness of hearing</dis> can be detected at birth by means of EAE.
Because of lack of awareness in the general population, universal screening is difficult.
Consequently, governments and medical organizations should legislate for such screening programs and should make the general population aware of them.Primary varicella-zoster infection is very common during childhood and few patients develop complications.
The most frequent complications are bacterial infection of the lesions, laryngitis and varicella pneumonia.
In the nervous system it can produce encephalitis and especially cerebellitis.
We describe a case of primary varicella-zoster induced rhabdomyolysis in a 5-year-old girl with <dis>mental retardation</dis>, microcephalia and mild diplegia who, in the context of varicella infection, presented extreme muscular weakness and prostration.
Blood and urine tests showed high creatine phosphokinase concentrations and myoglobinuria.
The patient received aggressive intravenous hydration.
Evolution was favorable with no renal failure.
Rhabdomyolysis can produce life-threatening complications such as renal failure, intravascular disseminated coagulation and hyperkaliemia.
The disease can be precipitated by alcohol ingestion, compression injury and generalized seizures.
Infectious etiology is less common.
Few reports have been published on primary varicella- zoster induced rhabdomyolysis but, because creatine phosphokinase concentrations are not routinely performed in varicella infection, very mild cases might have been under- diagnosed.
Despite its rarity, this disease should be considered in cases of infection, since early treatment with hyperhydration can prevent complications.Objective
To design, carry out and assess a protocol for the early diagnosis of <dis>hearing loss</dis> based on the detection of evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAE) in the neonatal period.
Materials and methods
Five hundred twenty-five infants <scp><neg>without</neg> risk factors for <dis>hearing loss</dis></scp> were studied.
A hearing screening protocol with EOAE was applied in the first 48 hours of life, with a second test on the fifth day of life, coinciding with phenylketonuria screening if the first test was negative.
The diagnostic stage took place when the infants were aged 1 month.
Results
A total of 98.8 % of the program was completed.
In the initial test, bilateral EOAE were obtained in 458 infants.
When the EOAE were performed during the first 24 hours after birth, 72.5 % of newborns achieved a satisfactory result.
This percentage rose to 93.6 %, 97.9 % and 94.7% when the test was delayed until discharge on, respectively, the second, the fifth and subsequent days of age (p < 0.01).
All the infants who did not achieve a satisfactory result in the first test underwent a second one.
A total of 87.5 % of the newborns who had failed the test within the first 24 hours passed it when it was repeated at 48 hours, at the time of discharge.
A third screening was necessary in seven infants (six on the fifth day of life and one, together with auditory brainstem response [ABR], on 30 days of age).
One infant showed absence of EOAE in the left ear in the three tests, as well as a threshold above 70 dB to obtain the V wave in the ABR performed at 1 and 3 months of age and was diagnosed with <dis>unilateral moderate deafness</dis>, representing a prevalence of <dis>hearing loss</dis> of 1.9% of live newborns in the general population in our environment.
Conclusions
Universal hearing screening with EOAE is logistically and economically feasible.
The use of a second test on the fifth day of age decreases the number of false positives, thus reducing economic cost and family anxiety, and improves recruitment, since it coincides with metabolic screening.Objectives
To determine morbidity at 2 years’ corrected age in a cohort of neonates with a birth weight of less than 1,500 g born in 1999-2000 in a tertiary hospital in the Autonomous Community of Madrid.
Patients and methods
An observational longitudinal follow-up study was performed in a cohort of 213 infants with a birth weight of < 1,500 g. Of these, 188 (87 %) completed the 2-year follow- up.
Various types of <dis>neurosensorial disability</dis> were studied, paying special attention to the main impairments: <dis>vision, hearing and motor impairment</dis>, and low development quotient.
Results
Among the patients initially included in the study, 87% completed the follow- up; 17.1 % had one or more major sequela.
We found one case (0.4 %) of <dis>bilateral neurosensorial deafness</dis> and one case of <dis>bilateral blindness</dis>.
At the age of 2 years, 5.8 % (11/188) had <dis>cerebral palsy</dis>, 14.9% had a development quotient below 85 and 18 % had not reached the 3rd percentile for weight.
Factors of poor neurological prognosis were subnormal head size at the age of 2 years and white matter disease (including persistent intraparenchymal periventricular echodensity and ventriculomegaly or irregular shape) as ultrasound findings.
Conclusions
Less than a fifth of the very low birth weight infants presented severe sequelae at 2 years of follow-up.
Factors of poor neurological prognosis were subnormal head size at 2 years and the presence of white matter disease on ultrasonography.
The findings on growth and development were worrying, since 18 % of the patients had not reached the 3rd percentile for weight at 2 years’ corrected age.Background
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the most important causes of <dis>blindness</dis> in childhood.
The introduction of diode laser has represented a significant advance in its treatment.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate our results in the treatment of this entity after more than a decade of experience.
Patients and methods
One hundred eighty-two eyes in 92 premature infants with ROP treated with diode laser in the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet from 1992 to 2003 were studied.
The characteristics of the population (gestational age, birth weight, sex, stage and affected zone) and treatment outcomes were analyzed.
The change in the criteria indicating this treatment was also analyzed.
Results
In the treated population, mean gestational age (27.9 weeks) and birth weight (1015.9 g) were similar to those in other published studies.
A favorable outcome was achieved in 169 of the 182 cases (92.8 %).
The change in criteria increased the proportion of favorable outcomes to 96.1%.
Discussion
Diode laser therapy is currently the treatment of choice in ROP.
This treatment, based on guidelines for earlier intervention, provide greater efficacy without increasing morbidity.Perinatal arterial stroke is a significant cause of neurological deficit, including <dis>mental retardation</dis>, <dis>delayed motor development</dis>, epilepsy, and <dis>severe cognitive impairment</dis>.
Most strokes occur in term neonates, due to thromboembolism from an intracranial or extracranial vessel associated with a risk factor such as asphyxia at birth and heart, hematological or infectious diseases.
An association with instrumental delivery has not been clearly demonstrated, although several cases have been described in the literature.
The incidence of stroke in the perinatal period is estimated to be 1/4000 term neonates per year.
We describe three new cases of stroke in term neonates with instrumental delivery and describe the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and outcome of this entity.Anomalies in WT-1 (Wilms’ tumor gene), mapped to 11p13, cause Denys-Drash, Frasier and WAGR syndromes.
WAGR syndrome is characterized by Wilms’ tumor (W), aniridia (A), genitourinary anomalies (G) and <dis>mental retardation</dis> (R).
In the early human fetus, WT-1 is expressed in the pleural and abdominal mesothelium, and consequently this gene may play a role in diaphragm development.
The first report of an association between WAGR syndrome and congenital diaphragmatic hernia has recently been published.
We present another infant with aniridia, left cryptorchidism with testicular dysgenesis, right-sided posterolateral diaphragmatic hernia and <dis>moderate psychomotor retardation</dis>, in whom genetic study showed a deletion of 11p13 and PAX-6, confirming the diagnosis of WAGR syndrome.Background
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), goiter is endemic in Spain.
The main cause of endemic goiter is iodine deficiency, which is also the principal cause of <dis>mental retardation</dis> and avoidable <dis>cerebral palsy</dis> throughout the world.
Material and methods
We conducted an observational study to determine the prevalence of endemic goiter and nutritional iodine status in the province of Alicante.
Urinary iodine excretion was measured in a morning urine sample, and thyroid volume was measured by means of a thyroid ultrasound scan.
A case of goiter was diagnosed if thyroid volume was above the 97th percentile adjusted by age, as published by the WHO.
Results
No cases of goiter were found.
In addition, the median urinary iodine excretion levels adjusted by age were within the normal range, as defined by the WHO's criteria.
Conclusions
Endemic goiter was not found in the province of Alicante and urinary iodine excretion values demonstrated adequate iodine intake.
Further ultrasound studies are needed to establish reference thyroid volumes for our population.Abstract
 Cases of metabolic alkalosis are divided into susceptible or resistant to treatment with sodium chloride, depending on the response to it.
The resistant cases present with high urinary excretion of chloride, and are secondary to tubular disease or use of diuretics.
Included among the sensitive cases are, vomiting, cystic fibrosis and low intake.
Two infants were fed with “almond milk” and showed clinical symptoms of dehydration and failure to thrive.
Hypochloraemic and hypokalaemic metabolic alkasosis was seen in both cases, which responded satisfactorily to water and electrolyte replacement.
After ruling out vomiting, ingestion of drugs, tubular disease, and cystic fibrosis, the diagnosis was low intake, due to poor contribution of Na+ and Cl− provided by the “almond milk”.
This deficit induces an increase in proximal tubular reabsorption of H−CO3 and in parts of the distal nephron, an increase in reabsorption of Na+ and Cl− which are exchanged with K+ and H+, which can give rise to a hypochloraemic alkalosis and hypokalaemia.
Secondary hypothyroidism was found in one case, apparently due to the lack of iodine in the almond milk, and disorders of the myelination characterized by optic neuritis and <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
These disorders were resolved when feeding with human formula was established.A female who was born after a gestation of 37 weeks without incident.
A caesarean was performed due to cephalopelvic disproportion.
She had no clavicles, dehiscence of the sagittal suture, large anterior fontanelle and occipital prominence.
A chest x-ray, abdominal and brain ultrasound and karyotype, was requested, with changes only seen in the x-ray,, which showe clavicular agenesis and flared chest.
Cleidocranial dysostosis was diagnosed a family study was started.
There are ten affected members in five generations.
The partial or total absence of clavicles, the late closure of cranial sutures and fontanelles, the diastasis of the pubic symphysis and the flared chest during the first days of life, are constant features.
Four presented characteristic facies and three delayed onset of first teeth which required extractions.
There is <dis>hearing loss</dis> in three of them.
The three documented childbirths were caesarean due to cephalopelvic disproportion.
Other alterations are failure to thrive, coxa vara and early osteoarthritis.Different studies show that <dis>mental retardation</dis> affects 1-3 % of the population, and in about 50 % of the cases the aetiology is unknown.
The uncertainty on the aetiology, and recurrence, means that prevention of <dis>mental retardation</dis> can have serious, therapeutic, social, and even economic repercussions.
The key is to obtain an accurate diagnosis, proving a clinical hypothesis by the accomplishment of the most suitable genetic tests.
Due to the increasing development of the technology in the field of the genetics, and the availability of new tests, this article reviews the criteria established in the practice guidelines from different scientific societies (paediatric, neurological and genetic) with respect to their use in diagnosis and integrates them from the point of view of their use in <dis>mental retardation</dis> and <dis>developmental delay</dis>.Abstract
 Background
Many genes are involved in testicular differentiation.
The alterations of these genes are responsible for sexual differentiation disorders with 46 XY karyotype.
Case
We report the case of a newborn who had an interscrotal hypospadias, palpable gonads and hypoplastic penis.
Karyotype 46 XY.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed testes and absence of Müllerian remnants.
There was a good response to the short gonadotrophin test.
At one year he had signs of <dis>psychomotor retardation</dis> and hypotonia.
The magnetic resonance revealed frontal-temporal atrophy and a decrease in the corpus callosum.
Testicular biopsy was compatible with gonadal dysgenesis.
A preoperative cystography showed a vaginal remnant.
Due to the presence of a sexual differentiation disorder, <dis>psychomotor retardation</dis> and facial dysmorphism, we requested a high-resolution karyotype: deletion 46, XY, del (9p) (p23-pter).
Ish tel (9p-).
Discussion
Many genes are involved in testicular differentiation, some of which also affect the development of other tissues.
In the short arm of chromosome 9, two genes, DMRT1 and DMRT2, are involved in sexual differentiation.
Their alterations have also been described as causing <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
In the evaluation of 46,XY disorders of sex differentiation, the accompanying signs are very important for guiding the genetic study.Abstract
 Introduction
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease, in which the main clinical features are increased bone fragility, pathological fractures, blue sclera, dentinogenesis imperfecta and <dis>conductive or mixed hearing loss</dis>.
Clinical variability is wide.
Although there is no curative treatment, there are several therapeutic tools capable of improving the course of the condition and patient quality of life.
Patients and methods
Sixty-five children seen in a Paediatric Hospital during six months in 2007 were evaluated.
Results
Thirty-five were type I OI, and thirty were types III–IV.
Median age was 7.8 years (range 1.9–19.2); mean length of follow up was 4.7 years.
The majority of children attended regular school for their corresponding age.
Mean height was −1.4 sDS and −5.64 sDS in types I and III–IV respectively.
Nineteen percent of patients were overweight and 11% were obese.
Mean age at first orthopaedic surgery inserting telescopic rods was 6.5 years.
Scoliosis was present in 44.6% of patients and was directly related to severity.
Bleck′s motor scale showed that 93% of patients with mild forms and 29% of severe forms had a sustainable walking ability.
A wheelchair was used by 25% of patients.
Family inheritance was confirmed in 65% of cases.
Conclusions
Integral care using a multidisciplinary approach is required due to the complexity and clinical variability of the condition.Abstract
 Isolated congenital hypoaldosteronism is a rare disorder that presents as chronic salt-wasting syndrome during infancy.
Aldosterone synthase deficiency due to mutations in _CYP11B2_ is the underlying cause in most cases.
Apart from the classical electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), no other extra-adrenal features have been described to date.
We report a male child with congenital hypoaldosteronism due to a homozygous missense mutation (Thr318Met) in _CYP11B2_ who also presented with <dis>unexplained sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.Abstract
 Postnatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in the newborn can occur from exposure to maternal cervical secretions during birth, ingestion of breast milk, transfusion of blood products or transmission by body fluids of infected people.
Breast milk is the main source of infection, given the high rate of CMV-positive mothers excreting CMV in milk.
Freezing reduces the risk of CMV transmission by breastfeeding, although it does not eliminate it completely.
Pasteurisation prevents such transmission, but it can alter the immunological properties of breast milk.
Postnatal CMV infection is usually asymptomatic, as it normally results from viral reactivation in the mother, and the neonate is born with protective antibodies.
However, in the very low birth weight premature infant the amount of transferred antibodies is smaller and a symptomatic infection can occur.
Symptomatic posnatal CMV infection in the newborn typically causes hepatitis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or sepsis-like syndrome.
Pneumonitis and enteritis are less common, but very characteristic.
Diagnosis is based on urine virus detection at the time of onset of symptoms.
Postnatal CMV infection in the newborn generally resolves spontaneously without antiviral treatment.
Ganciclovir should be reserved for severe cases.
Unlike congenital CMV disease, posnatal CMV infection in the preterm infant does not seem to be associated with <dis>hearing loss</dis> or abnormal neuro-development in long term follow-up.Abstract
 Background
As there are no biological markers for <dis>Autism Spectrum Disorders</dis> (<dis>ASD</dis>), screening must focus on behaviour and the presence of a markedly <dis>abnormal development</dis> or a <dis>deficiency in verbal and non-verbal social interaction and communication</dis>.
Objective
To evaluate the psychometric attributes of a Spanish version of the autism domain of the Autism-Tics, AD/HD and other Comorbidities Inventory (A-TAC) scale for <dis>ASD</dis> screening.
Material and methods
A total of 140 subjects (43% male, 57% female) aged 6-16, with <dis>ASD</dis> (n = 15), <dis>Mental Retardation</dis> (n = 40), <dis>Psychiatric Illness</dis> (n = 22), Tics (n = 12) and controls (n = 51), were included for <dis>ASD</dis> screening.
The predictive validity, acceptability, scale assumptions, internal consistency, and precision were analysed.
Results
The internal consistency was high (α = 0.93), and the standard error was adequate (1.13 [95% CI, -1.08 a 3.34]).
The mean scores of the Autism module were higher in patients diagnosed with <dis>ASD</dis> and <dis>mental disability</dis> compared to the rest of the patients ( _P_ < .001).
The area under the curve was 0.96 for the <dis>ASD</dis> group.
Conclusion
The autism domain of the A-TAC scale seems to be a reliable, valid and precise tool for <dis>ASD</dis> screening in the Spanish school population.Abstract
 Introduction
The aim of our study is to describe the epidemiology, clinical evolution, and the anatomical and neurological factors involved in polymicrogyria in 34 patients with this disorder.
Subjects and methods
We have compiled 34 patients diagnosed and/or in follow-up at the Department of Paediatric Neurology of the Hospital Infantil Niño Jesús between 1995 and 2010.
All the patients had a magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of polymicrogyria, and most of the patients still have periodic checks, thus their outcome is known.
Results
The large majority were male (76.5%).
The median age at presentation was 10 months; the reason for the study was <dis>psychomotor or mental delay</dis> (44%) followed by seizures (38.2%).
During the condition patients presented with epilepsy (61.7%), <dis>infantile cerebral palsy</dis> (47%), <dis>psychomotor/mental retardation</dis> (94.1%), <dis>pervasive developmental disorder</dis> (26.4%), <dis>behavioural disturbances</dis> (38.2%), <dis>neurosensory deficit</dis> (35.2%) and microcephaly 67.6%.
In 82.3% of patients there was bilateral involvement (42.8% perisylvian).
Other abnormalities were observed in the MRI of 58.8% of patients.
The electroencephalogram at diagnosis showed changes in 41.1%, and this rose to 67.6% during follow-up.
61.7% received antiepileptic treatment was received by 61.7% of patients, with 52.3% requiring ≥2 drugs.
Epilepsy surgery was performed on two patients.
Some type of sequelae was observed in 91.1% of patients.
The aetiology was unknown in 61.7%; a congenital infection was suspected in 10 patients and syndromic or polymalformative disorder in three patients.
Conclusions
This study shows the range of clinical and radiological expression in polymicrogyria, in addition to the possibilities for the future in terms of determining the aetiology of this pathology.Abstract
 3q29 microduplication (MIM 611936) is rare syndrome characterized by <dis>moderate mental retardation</dis>, craniofacial dysmorphic features and musculoskeletal anomalies.
The size of the minimal critical region is about 1.73 Mb.
It is flanked by repetitive sequences and it is similar in size to the reciprocal 3q29 microdeletion, suggesting a non-allelic homologous recombination event (NAHR) at flanking LCR sequences as its aetiological mechanism.
We describe a new familial case with variable expressivity.Abstract
 Introduction
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are a group of inherited autosomal recessive lysosomal diseases, most commonly found in infancy.
These are neuropathologically characterised by accumulation of an autofluorescent lipopigment in neurons and other cells.
This condition is clinically characterised by <dis>loss of motor and cognitive skills</dis>, lack of motor coordination, <dis>ataxia</dis>, <dis>progressive visual impairment</dis>, behavioural changes; seizures of difficult to manage seizures, particularly myoclonic, and premature death.
Ten clinical forms have been described, one of which is late infantile where clinical signs begin between two and four years.
The gene responsible for this disease is located at 11p15 locus, and the enzyme encoded by this gene is the tripeptidyl peptidase 1.
Patients and methods
We standardised the technique for the enzymatic diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses from dried blood on filter paper card in 76 healthy individuals adults and children in order to establish a normal range in the Venezuelan population.
The tripeptidyl peptidase activity was also determined in 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.
Results
Six of the samples showed activity lower than the lowest control value (0.11 to 0.45 nmol/spot) from healthy controls of infantile age, confirming the enzymatic diagnosis.
Three of the 14 parent samples analysed showed values in the heterozygote ranges.
Conclusions
The enzymatic diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses from dried blood on filter paper card is a rapid, easier, less expensive and accurate molecular diagnosis tool.Abstract
 Introduction
Researching <dis>inherited mental retardation</dis>, from a diagnostic and aetiological point of view, is a great challenge.
A particular type of <dis>mental retardation</dis> is the one linked to the X chromosome which is classified under syndromic and non-syndromic types, according to the presence or absence of a specific physical, neurological or metabolic pattern associated with <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
Patients and method
Five generations of a family have been studied with eight males suffering from <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
Six of these males were clinically tested using anthropometric indicators and genetic tests: high resolution karyotypes, fragile X research, linkage and MID1 and PQBP1 gene studies.
Results
Along with <dis>mental retardation</dis> _,_ the clinical study showed a pattern of microcephaly, micrognathia, osteoarticular and genital anomalies, short stature and other less frequent malformations.
The linkage study mapped the possible causal gene of this <dis>mental retardation syndrome</dis> and multiple congenital abnormalities in the Xp11.23-q21.32 segment, with a LOD score of 2.
As far as we know, a medical profile, similar to the one these patients have, linked to this X segment has not been described.
Conclusions
We suspect that this family has a “new syndrome” of <dis>mental retardation</dis> and multiple congenital anomalies linked to the X chromosome.Abstract
 Introduction
Kabuki syndrome (OMIM: #147 920) presents as large palpebral fissures with eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelids, depressed nasal bridge, arched eyebrows, dysplastic ears and in most cases, with <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
Patients have minor and major abnormalities in different systems.
Its genetic basis is heterogeneous, but recently has been associated with mutations in gen MLL2.
Case reports
We present two patients with clinical features compatibles with the syndrome, mainly: large palpebral fissures with eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelids, depressed nasal bridge, arched eyebrows, flat nose, persistent fingertip pads, cardiopathies and renal anomalies.
Commentary
The diagnosis of this condition is clinical.
The characteristics in the cases are compared with the patients reported in the literature.
The importance of early diagnosis is to provide preventive management and an appropriate genetic counseling for the family.Abstract
 Objective
To describe growth and neurodevelopmental status of 4,944 children who completed a follow-up at two years of corrected age out of the 10,456 newborns with weight ≤ 1500 g born between the years 2002-2007 and discharged from hospitals within the network SEN1500.
A total of 522 newborns were excluded as they had some type of malformation.
The total number of children assessed represents the 49.76% of children discharged alive and without malformations.
Methods
A retrospective review was conducted using prospectively collected data in the SEN1500 database.
We compared growth data at two years of corrected age according to birth weight and sex.
<dis>Motor impairment</dis>, incidence of <dis>cerebral palsy</dis>, <dis>visual and hearing disabilities</dis>, and abnormal neurodevelopment for gestational age were analysed between groups.
We studied the associations between <dis>cerebral palsy</dis> (<dis>CP</dis>) and perinatal factors.
Results
At 2 years of age 44.2% of children had a weight < 2 SD for corrected age.
Children with birth weight ≤ 1000 g showed worse outcomes in growth.
Some type of <dis>motor impairment</dis> was observed in 6.96% of the infants, and 4.56% of them were diagnosed with <dis>CP</dis>.
The incidence was higher among males with birth weight ≤ 1000g. 
There was an incidence of 5.21% of <dis>visual disability</dis>, with 0.5% of children being <dis>blind</dis> in one or both eyes.
<dis>Cerebral palsy</dis> was associated with retinopathy of prematurity, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia, in particular cystic periventricular leukomalacia.
Abstract
 Objectives
To determine the prevalence of <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis> in primary care pediatrics in Atlantic Galicia.
Methods
An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional prevalence study was carried out in 9 outpatient clinics in A Coruña and Pontevedra with a population of 8293 children between September and November 2015.
A total of 1286 randomly selected patients from 0 to 14 years of age were included.
From the medical history was registered: age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis established by DSM-IV- TR criteria in its five axes, professionals who participated in the diagnosis and treatment of the process and what type of treatment was received.
Authorization was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of Galicia number 2015/427.
Results
148 of 1286 patients presented psychiatric pathology (11,5% IC 95% 9.73-13,29), 68% male.
Between 0 and 5 years, the prevalence was 4.5%; between 6 y and 10y, 18.5% and between 11y and 14y 22%.
Symptoms lasted a median of 25 months.
The most frequent pathologies in 1286 patients were ADHD (5.36%), <dis>language disorders</dis> (3.42%), <dis>learning disorders</dis> (3.26%), anxiety-depressive disorders (2.4%) and <dis>behavior disorders</dis> (1.87%).
Of the 148 cases, 47% had comorbidity with another <dis>mental disorder</dis>.
Most of them required attention by multiple social, health and educational professionals; 33% received psychopharmacological treatment.
Conclusions
The prevalence of <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis> in pediatric primary care is frequent, chronic and complex, increases with age and requires many health, educational and social resources.Abstract
 Outcome prediction is an important component of treatment planning and prognosis.
However, reliable predictors of intensive behavioral intervention (IBI) have not been clearly established.
IBI is an evidence-based approach to the systematic teaching of academic, social, verbal, and daily living skills to individuals with <dis>autism spectrum disorder</dis>.
Incorporating longitudinal analysis to IBI outcome studies may help to identify outcome predictors of clinical value.
Twenty-four children with <dis>autism</dis> underwent on average two years of IBI and completed language, daily living skills, cognitive, and motor assessments (Early Learning Accomplishment Profile and the Learning Accomplishment Profile-Diagnostic, 3rd edition) every six months.
We used multilevel analysis to identify potential longitudinal predictors including gender, age, intervention intensity, intervention duration, total intervention time, and pre-intervention functioning.
Results indicated that total intervention time, pre-intervention functioning, and age caused the greatest increase in goodness-of-fit of the longitudinal multilevel models.
Longitudinal analysis is a promising analytical strategy to identify reliable predictors of the clinical outcome of IBI.Abstract
 Background
In recent years there have been changes in neurooncology that have improved quality of life and survival for patients with primary CNS tumors (PCNST).
Objectives
To present the clinical features of a cohort of patients with primary CNS glial tumors.
Materials and methods
One hundred and forty-eight patients with PCNST were followed up between 2002 and 2009.
Only glial type PCNST was studied.
This is a descriptive study.
Results
Seventy-nine patients (52 males and 27 females) presented glial type PCNST.
In most of the cases, tumors appeared in the fourth decade.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 34, GIII astrocytoma 6, GII astrocytoma 9, GI astrocytoma 5, brainstem glioma 3, chordoid glioma 1, GII oligodendroglioma 16 and GIII oligodendroglioma 5 were diagnosed according to the WHO histological tumor classification.
The frontal lobe was the most frequent location.
Initial symptomatology in order of frequency was: seizures, headache, <dis>aphasia</dis>, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, motor weakness, <dis>sensorial deficits</dis>, cranial nerve involvement and intracranial hypertension syndrome.
Surgery/radiotherapy/chemotherapy (Sx/Rt/Cht) was performed in 27 patients; Rt/Cht 20, Sx 6, Cht 6, Rt 5, Sx/Cht 5, Sx/Rt 4 and 6 patients were not treated.
Partial or complete tumor resection occurred in 51% of patients.
In 66% of the cases, the epileptic seizures (62% partials, 38% generalized) were succesfully controlled with monotherapy.
Conclusions
GBM was the most frequent tumor, and the frontal lobe was the most affected.
Seizures were the prevalent symptom.
We observed a suboptimal percentage of patients with partial or complete tumor resection.Abstract
 Objective
The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of family caregiver's beliefs of health status of neurological patients and its relation with the feeling of burden, as psychosocial factors of risk for their well-being, from the psychological stress model proposed by Lazarus and Folkman.
Subjects and methods
128 family caregivers were interviewed (35 were attending patients with traumatic brain injury, 38 to patients with multiple sclerosis and 55 patients with <dis>dementia</dis>), selected with not random statistical sampling strategy, of accidental type.
Cross-sectional comparative descriptive design was applied.
A caregiver socio demographic questionnaire, that includes a question about the beliefs of the patients’ health, and the Caregiver Burden Scale of Zarit and Zarit were used.
Results
The more negative caregiver's beliefs are, the more intense are their feeling of burden.
Multiple sclerosis's caregivers, who evaluate their own health as poor, when compared with other caregivers; are the ones who experience more intense feelings of burden.
They will be most likely vulnerable to stress.
Discussion
It is important to clarify the role that psychosocial risk factors of the familiar caregiver of neurological patients because it will generate strategies of psychoeducational interventions, parallel to the clinic ones, in order to preserve their security and well-being.
And in this way promote a good network of informal care to these patients.Abstract
 Fibromyalgia (FM) was accepted as an entity by WHO in 1992.
Diagnostic criteria were stated initially in 1990 and modified recently in 2010.
The clinical feature is characterized by widespread chronic pain in muscles, joints, and in soft tissues and is associated to <dis>sleep, attention and mood disorders</dis>.
Moreover, FM affects functional activities and decrease quality of life and leads to psycho-social conflicts.
The course of the disease fluctuates along months to many years.
There is a long delay between the onset of the symptoms and its correct diagnosis.
FM involves 2 - 4.7% of the general population with a high prevalence in women.
Patients feel pain at lesser stimulation intensity than most healthy subjects.
Not specific biological marker has been found to diagnose FM, but through brain Functional Magnetic Resonance, focal hyperactivity has been identified, which correlates with clinical features in FM.
Different patophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as genetic predisposition and a failure of the central inhibitory pathway of pain.
Several authors have objected to that theory and have postulated psychogenic factors as poor pain adaptation.
FM treatment includes pregabalin, duloxetine and milnacipran, combined with educational, psychotherapy and gradual physical exercising.
This review presents a critic vision of FM aimed at the practitioner Neurologist who assists daily patients with FM.Abstract
 Background Introduction
In recent years, an increasing number of studies published assessing the effectiveness of CT programs in patients with ABD have shown that these therapies may have beneﬁcial effects on cognitive and functional measures.
On the other hand, the efficacy of these type of treatment in patients with ND is still under debate.
Objective
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of a Cognitive Training (CT) program in patients with Acquired Brain Damage (ABD) and neurodegenerative diseases (ND).
Design/Methods
144 patients were assessed with neuropsychological, neurological, neuropsychiatry and functional assessments.
The sample was divided in three groups: ABD (G1), ND (G2) and mixed disorders (G3).
G1 included mainly patients with Traumatic Brain injury and Stroke.
G2 included patients with <dis>degenerative dementias</dis> and <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>.
Groups were matched for age, education and number of CT sessions.
The effects on cognition, behavioral, functional and quality of life (QOL) were considered as the primary outcome measures, and evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the CT program.
Results
Within G1 patients (n = 43) an improvement was found in patient's basic (-1.55;p0.04) and instrumental (-1.63;p0.007) activities of daily living (ADL) scores, subjective memory measures (13.36;p0.02) and in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (7.73;p0.03).
In G2 (n = 34) an improving trend was found in instrumental ADL (-1.3;p0.08) and in some aspects of QOL (-1.59;p0.06).
No significant differences were observed within G3 patients (n = 12).
Conclusions
These results suggest that persons with ABD and neurodegenerative disease may improve some cognitive, behavioral, functional and QOL measures following a CT program.
CT shows greater benefit for ABD patients.Abstract
 Introduction
Basic emotions are biologically determined emotional states, their expression and recognition is universal and innate.
Complex emotions arise from the combination of basic emotions and their recognition is achieved by means of Theory of Mind (ToM).
Objective
To investigate the presence of alterations in facial recognition of basic emotions (FRBE) and its relation to the recognition of complex emotions in a group of patients with <dis>beheavioural variant of Frontotemporal Dementia</dis> (<dis>bvFTD</dis>).
Patients and methods
Sixty pictures from the Pictures of Facial Affect set were selected based on Calder et al.
(1996) selection and a three tests battery for FRBE was administrated.
The test of complex emotions Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) was also administered.
Subjects: A cohort of 14 patients diagnosed with <dis>bvFTD</dis> from Laboratorio de Deterioro Cognitivo - HIGA Eva Perón, and a control group for FRBE tasks.
A multiple study of isolated cases was conducted.
Results
Significant differences between controls and patients were found for FRBE.
RME showed correlations with the three tasks FRBE: Selection (r: .570, _P_ = .034), Mating (r: .600, _P_ = .023), and Naming (r: .770, _P_ = .001).
Double dissociations were observed between LMO and RFEB tasks.
Conclusions
The presence of group-level correlations could indicate that basic emotions are involved in the formation of secondary emotions.
However, the presence of double dissociations between tasks could indicate that its execution involves partially independent processes.Abstract
 <dis>Cognitive impairment</dis> may compromise driving skills and represent a public health risk by increasing traffic accidents.
<dis>Mild Cognitive Impairment</dis> and <dis>Dementia</dis> are characterized by <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> affecting to a greater or lesser degree the instrumental activities of daily living and fitness to drive.
The Argentine Neurologic Society Working Group on Behavioural Neurology and Cognitive Neurosciences has prepared this clinical practice guideline to help physicians evaluate patients suspected to present <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> or <dis>dementia</dis> and detect and prevent risky behaviors.Abstract
 Susac's syndrome is a rare disease, characterized by encephalopathy, <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> and retinal artery occlusion.
In this paper, we present the case of a woman who presented the complete triad, with typical features on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance images of the brain, and we review other cases reported in our country.Abstract
 Introduction
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy due to the accumulation of altered prion protein isoform (PrPsc) in the brain.
The typical clinical symptoms are <dis>rapidly progressive dementia</dis>, <dis>ataxia</dis>, myoclonus, electroencephalogram (EEG) alterations, with positive 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid and changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The definitive diagnosis is done anatomopathologically.
Case report
A 64 year old female patient who presented with <dis>rapid progressive ataxia</dis>, <dis>visual disturbances</dis>, <dis>dysarthria</dis>, dysdiadochokinesia, dysmetria and axial dystonia.
She also presented with <dis>apraxia</dis>, atrophy, myoclonus and seizures.
She died 4 months after onset, with <dis>severe motor deterioration</dis>, rigidity, flexed posture and <dis>low cognitive-behavioral impairment</dis>.
We did an anatomopathological study in addition to molecular biology.
Conclusions
We present a “defined” case study of ECJ with infrequent symptoms of <dis>ataxia</dis>, myoclonus, but <scp>with <neg>no</neg> <dis>cognitive deterioration</dis> for its genotype</scp> (M/V1).
Despite inconclusive 14-3-3 protein levels and atypical EEG, our diagnosis was mainly guided by the rapid onset of symptoms, in which high-field MRI (with the appropriate sequences) were key in showing typical images and in defining the diagnosis.Abstract
 Introduction
The theory of mental simulation argues that we represent the mental states of other people by internally imitating them.
Before recognizing the facial expression of emotions, we automatically simulate them.
The motor simulation mechanism is activated by observing symbolic gestures, which activates our representations of these same actions.
The aim was to study the relationship between motor simulation and mental simulation by evaluating praxias and the facial recognition of basic emotions, with consideration of both conceptual components and production components in the production of gestures in patients with <dis>behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia</dis>.
Methods
We examined 13 subjects diagnosed with <dis>behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia</dis> at the Neurology Service of HIGA Eva Perón.
To assess the recognition of emotions, we administered recognition, selection and pairing tasks.
In turn, we used battery praxias, and considered both content errors and temporospatial errors.
Results
92.3% of patients had <dis>apraxia</dis> and 61.5% showed alterations in facial emotion recognition.
The latter correlated with five measures of praxias with a significant association between both batteries.
Temporospatial errors correlated with emotion recognition tasks.
Conclusions
Based on the associations found, we suggest that there is a relationship between motor simulation and mental simulation.
This relationship is based on the spatiotemporal component and not on the conceptual aspect of the production of gestures.Abstract
 Introduction
Parkinson's Disease diagnosis is supported in clinical criteria, it is frequently observed that the progression of PD varies among different individuals.
Objective
To evaluate the clinical progression in 100 PDp with more than five years of follow up in a Movement Disorders Section.
Materials and methods
We reviewed 100 Medical records of PDp with more than five years of follow-up.
We analyzed the demographic characteristics, mean age to diagnosis, the latencies of progression to Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) I to II, HY II to III, and III to IV.
Time of onset of the hallucinations, falls, <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and care needed for activities of daily living (ADL), as milestones of advanced disease.
Results
We found similar interval times between the different H&Y stages.
We observed a faster progression to <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and needed of care in ADL in patients over 50 years old at the onset of PD _(P_ <.05).
Falls were the most frequent complaint found as an advanced disease's milestone (43%).
<dis>Cognitive impairment</dis>, hallucinations and falls were associated to higher needs of care in ADL.
Conclusions
The progression of PD and the severity of parkinsonian signs and symptoms differ widely among patients.
Falls, hallucinations and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> were related to higher needs of care in ADL, suggesting they may be considered risk factors in the progression of the disease.Stroke in young individuals has multiple etiologies, including cardioembolism. 
It may be associated with cardiac malformations, such as patent foramen ovale (PFO), interatrial septum aneurysm (IASA), or atrial septal defects (ASD). 
We present the case of a patient with stroke associated to multi-fenestrated IASA. 
Female patient, 28 years old, contraceptive use. 
She presented with <dis>mixed aphasia</dis>, hemianopsia and <dis>right hemiparesis</dis>. 
CT scan showed insular and left basal ganglia hypoattenuation. 
She received intravenous thrombolysis. 
MRI: left middle cerebral artery infarction. 
Echocardiogram showed interatrial communication due to IASA and multi-fenestrated ASD. 
Cardioembolic stroke was suspected (association with cardiac pathology and contraceptive use). 
She was placed in anticoagulation. 
30% of strokes in young adults are cardioembolic strokes. 
Large PFO, multi-fenestrated IASA, or its association, may increase the risk of paradoxical embolization and have a relationship with stroke. 
The management is controversial–the choice is between anticoagulation or closure for complex defects.
Bariatric surgery is an effective therapy for patients with medical treatment-resistant morbid obesity. 
Improves anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risks and life quality. 
However, bariatric surgery procedures increases the risk of nutritional deficit, and can cause postoperative neurological complications as encephalopathy, <dis>ataxia</dis> or polyneuropathies; or aggravate an existing neuropathy. 
Usually, these complications are more frequent in malabsorptive procedures than in restrictive ones.
We present a clinical case of a patient with <dis>spinocerebellar ataxia</dis> who undergoes bariatric surgery. 
Successfully, bariatric surgery has been achieved in a patient with <dis>ataxia</dis> and hypoalbuminemia, without nutritional or neurological worsening in the medium term.Abstract
 Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of <dis>blindness</dis> in individuals older than 65 years of age.
It is a multifactorial disorder and identification of risk factors enables individuals to make lifestyle choices that may reduce the risk of disease.
Collaboration between geneticists, ophthalmologists, and optometrists suggests that genetic risk factors play a more significant role in AMD than previously thought.
The most important genes are associated with immune system modulation and the complement system, e.g., complement factor H (CFH), factor B (CFB), factor C3, and serpin peptidase inhibitor (SERPING1).
Genes associated with membrane transport, e.g., ATP- binding cassette protein (ABCR) and voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma 3 (CACNG3), the vascular system, e.g., fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), fibulin-5, lysyl oxidase-like gene (LOXL1) and selectin-P (SELP), and with lipid metabolism, e.g., apolipoprotein E (APOE) and hepatic lipase (LIPC) have also been implicated.
In addition, several other genes exhibit some statistical association with AMD, e.g., age-related maculopathy susceptibility protein 2 (ARMS2) and DNA excision repair protein gene (ERCC6) but more research is needed to establish their significance.
Modifiable risk factors for AMD should be discussed with patients whose lifestyle and/or family history place them in an increased risk category.
Furthermore, calculation of AMD risk using current models should be recommended as a tool for patient education.
It is likely that AMD management in future will be increasingly influenced by assessment of genetic risk as such screening methods become more widely available.Abstract
 <dis>Attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder</dis> (<dis>ADHD</dis>) is a common neuro-behavioural disorder with onset in childhood.
These children have impaired emotional self- control, self-regulation of drive and motivation.
Numerous studies have reported <dis>cognitive disabilities in memory, executive functions, spatial abilities and language skills</dis>.
The main objective of this work is to determine whether a socio-emotional intervention programme could improve executive functions in children with <dis>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</dis>.
The sample of this study consisted of 25 children (8 female and 17 male) aged between 8 and 12 years, diagnosed with <dis>ADHD</dis> and who were not taking any psychopharmacological treatment at the time of the study, and had not taken medication previously.
Executive functioning was assessed through the Zoo Map test and Tower of Hanoi puzzle in pre-/post-test design.
A socio-emotional intervention programme was implemented.
The training consisted of 8 one-hour weekly sessions, on an individual basis.
Results indicate that such a programme does lead to improved performance in the execution of tasks that evaluate executive functions.
After the intervention, the children took less time to resolve the Zoo Map test.
Results for the Hanoi Tower puzzle were also improved after intervention.
The children needed a lower number of movements to complete the task.Abstract
 Position statement from the European Psychiatric Association (EPA), supported by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).
People with <dis>severe mental illnesses</dis>, such as schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder, have worse physical health and reduced life expectancy compared to the general population.
The excess cardiovascular mortality associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is attributed to an increased risk of the modifiable coronary heart disease risk factors, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.
Antipsychotic medication and possibly other psychotropic medication like antidepressants can induce weight gain and further increase the risk of adverse metabolic effects which may result in further increased incidence of cardiovascular disease.
Patients have limited access to general healthcare with less opportunity for cardiovascular risk screening and prevention than would be expected in a non- psychiatric population.
The European Psychiatric Association (EPA), supported by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published this statement aiming to improve the care of patients suffering from <dis>severe mental illness</dis>.
The intention is to initiate co-operation and shared care between the different health care professionals and to increase the awareness of psychiatrists caring for patients suffering from <dis>severe mental illness</dis> to screen and treat increased cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes.
Abstract
 Introduction
We report the case of a 14-year-old girl with <dis>mental retardation</dis> and dysmorphic features referred to child psychiatry because of altered behavior at school.
Material and methods
Karyotyping (GTG banding), _in situ_ fluorescent hybridization (FISH) and molecular study of parental origin by polymorphic STS were performed.
Results
Genetic study revealed a 48,XXXX karyotype with a maternal origin of the X-tetrasomy.
The mechanism was successive non-dysjunction at meiosis I and II.
Conclusions
The interest of this case lies in the rarity of the chromosomal anomaly and its late diagnosis, leading to a failure to adapt the girl's education to her needs, with consequences for her psyche.Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Functional deficits</dis> are commonly observed in bipolar disorder after symptomatic remission.
<dis>Social cognition deficits</dis> have also been reported, which could contribute to dysfunction in patients with bipolar disorder in remission.
Material and methods
Twelve bipolar disorder patients in symptomatic remission (7 patients with bipolar disorder type I and 5 with bipolar disorder type II) and 12 healthy controls completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Faux Pas Test to evaluate theory of mind (ToM).
Both groups also completed the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST).
Results
The performance of the bipolar patients in the cognitive component of ToM was below normal, although the difference between the control group was not statistically significant ( _P_ = .078), with a trend to a worse performance associated with a higher number of depressive episodes ( _P_ = .082).
There were no statistically significant differences between groups for the emotional component of ToM.
Global functionality was significantly lower in bipolar patients compared to the control group ( _P_ = .001).
Significant differences were also observed between both groups in five of the six dimensions of functionality assessed.
No significant correlation was found between functionality and theory of mind.
Conclusions
Bipolar patients in symptomatic remission exhibit <dis>impairments in several areas of functioning</dis>.
Cognitive ToM appears more affected than emotional ToM.
Deficits in ToM were not related to <dis>functional impairment</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
In patients with <dis>severe mental disorders</dis> outcome measurement should include symptoms, cognition, functioning and quality of life at least.
Shorter and efficient instruments have greater potential for pragmatic and valid clinical utility.
Our aim was to develop the Spanish UPSA Brief scale (Sp-UPSA-Brief).
Material and methods
Naturalistic, 6-month follow-up, multicentre study.
139 patients with schizophrenia, 57 with bipolar disorder and 31 controls were evaluated using the Sp-UPSA, CGI-S, GAF, and PSP.
We conducted a multivariate linear regression model to identify candidate subscales for the Sp-UPSA-Brief.
Results
The stepwise regression model for patients with schizophrenia showed that communication and transportation Sp-UPSA subscales entered first and second at p < 0.0001 (R2 = 0.88, model _df_ = 2, F = 395.05).
In patients with bipolar disorder transportation and communication Sp-UPSA subscales entered first and second at p < 0.0001 (R2 = 0.87, model df = 2, F = 132.32).
Cronbach's _alpha_ was 0.78 in schizophrenia and 0.64 in bipolar patients.
Test-retest was 0.66 and 0.64 (p < 0.0001) respectively.
Pearson correlation coefficients between Sp-UPSA and Sp-UPSA-Brief were 0.93 for schizophrenia and 0.92 for bipolar patients (p < 0.0001).
The Sp-UPSA-Brief discriminated between patients and controls.
In schizophrenia patients it also discriminated among different levels of illness severity according to CGI-S scores.
Conclusion
The Sp-UPSA-Brief is an alternate instrument to evaluate functional capacity that is valid and reliable.
Having a shorter instrument makes it more feasible to assess functional capacity in patients with <dis>severe mental disorders</dis>, especially in everyday clinical practice.
Abstract
 Introduction
We used data from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 to report on the burden of <dis>neuropsychiatric disorders</dis> in Spain.
Materials and methods
The summary measure of burden used in the study was the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), which sums of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years lived with disability (YLDs).
DALYs were adjusted for comorbidity and estimated with 95% uncertainty intervals.
Results
The burden of <dis>neuropsychiatric disorders</dis> accounted for 18.4% of total all- cause DALYs generated in Spain for 2010.
Within this group, the top five leading causes of DALYs were: depressive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, migraine, substance-use disorders, and anxiety disorder, which accounted for 70.9% of all DALYs due to <dis>neuropsychiatric disorders</dis>.
Neurological disorders represented 5.03% of total all cause YLLs, whereas <dis>mental and substance-use disorders</dis> accounted for 0.8%.
<dis>Mental and substance-use disorders</dis> accounted for 22.4% of total YLDs, with depression being the most disabling disorder.
Neurological disorders represented 8.3% of total YLDs.
Conclusions
<dis>Neuropsychiatric disorders</dis> were one of the leading causes of disability in 2010.
This finding contributes to our understanding of the burden of <dis>neuropsychiatric disorders</dis> in the Spanish population and highlights the importance of prioritising <dis>neuropsychiatric disorders</dis> in the Spanish public health system.Introduction
Patients with schizophrenia sometimes internalise social stigma associated to <dis>mental illness</dis>, and they develop personal stigma. 
Personal stigma includes self-stigma (internalisation of negative stereotypes), perceived stigma (perception of rejection), and experienced stigma (experiences of discrimination). 
Personal stigma is linked with a poorer treatment adherence, and worst social functioning. 
For this reason, it is important to have good measurements of personal stigma. 
One of the most frequently used measurements is the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale. 
There is a Spanish version of the scale available, although its psychometric properties have not been studied. 
The main aim of this study is to analyse the psychometric properties of a new Spanish version of the ISMI scale.
Material and methods
The new version was translated as Estigma Interiorizado de Enfermedad Mental (EIEM). 
Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were calculated in a sample of 69 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 
The rate of patients showing personal stigma was also studied, as well as the relationship between personal stigma and sociodemographic and clinical variables.
Results
The adapted version obtained good values of internal consistency and test-retest reliability, for the total score of the scale (0.91 and 0.95 respectively), as well as for the five subscales of the EIEM, except for the Stigma Resistance subscale (Cronbach's alpha 0.42).
Conclusions
EIEM is an appropriate measurement tool to assess personal stigma in a Spanish population with <dis>severe mental disorder</dis>, at least in those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.Introduction
People with <dis>severe mental disorder</dis> have <dis>significant difficulties in everyday life that involve the need for continued support</dis>. 
These needs are not easily measurable with the currently available tools. 
Therefore, a multidimensional scale that assesses the different levels of need for care is proposed, including a study of its psychometric properties.
Method
One-hundred and thirty-nine patients (58% men) with a <dis>severe mental disorder</dis> were assessed using the Required Care Levels for People with Severe Mental Disorder Assessment Scale (ENAR-TMG), the Camberwell Assessment of Need scale, and the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales. 
ENAR-TMG's psychometric features were examined by: a) evaluating 2 sources of validity evidence (evidence based on internal structure and evidence based on relations to other variables), and b) estimating the internal consistency, temporal stability, inter-rater reliability, and sensitivity to change of scores of the ENAR-TMG's subscales.
Results
Exploratory factor analyses revealed a one-factor structure for each of the theoretical dimensions of the scale, in which all but one showed a significant and positive correlation with the Camberwell Assessment of Need (range of r: 0.143-0.557) and Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (range of r: 0.241-0.474) scales. 
ENAR-TMG subscale scores showed acceptable internal consistency (range of ordinal α coefficients: 0.682-0.804), excellent test-retest (range of intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.889-0.999) and inter-rater reliabilities (range of intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.926-0.972), and satisfactory sensitivity to treatment-related changes (range of η2: 0.003-0.103).
Conclusions
The satisfactory psychometric behaviour of the ENAR-TMG makes the scale a promising tool to assess global functioning in people with a <dis>severe mental disorder</dis>.Introduction.
Suicide is a major public health problem worldwide, and an approach is necessary due to its high potential for prevention. 
This paper examines the main characteristics of people admitted to hospitals in the Community of Madrid (Spain) with suicidal behaviour, and the factors associated with their hospital mortality.

Material and methods.
A study was conducted on patients with E950-E959 codes of suicide and self-inflicted injuries of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, contained in any diagnostic field of the minimum basic data set at hospital discharge between 2003 and 2013. 
Sociodemographic, clinical and health care variables were assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis in the evaluation of factors associated with hospital mortality.

Results.
Hospital suicidal behaviour predominates in women (58.7%) and in middle-age. 
Hospital mortality is 2.2% (1.6% in women and 3.2% in men), increasing with age. 
<dis>Mental disorders</dis> are detected 3-4 times more in secondary diagnoses. 
The main primary diagnosis (>74%) is poisoning with substances, with lower mortality (∼1%) than injury by hanging and jumping from high places (≥12%), which have the highest numbers. 
Other factors associated with increased mortality include different medical comorbidities and severity of the injury, while length of stay and <dis>mental disorders</dis> are protective factors. 
Type of hospital, poisoning, and Charlson index are associated differently with mortality in men and women.

Conclusions.
Hospitalised suicidal acts show a low mortality, mainly related to comorbidities and the severity of injuries.
Background
Cardiovascular and metabolic monitoring of patients on antipsychotic medication is essential. 
This becomes more important in those of paediatric age, as they are more vulnerable, and also because prescriptions of this kind of drugs are still increasing.
Aim
To evaluate the monitoring of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in a group of children and young people on antipsychotic medication.
Method
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in which a group of 220 patients aged 8-17 years, diagnosed with a <dis>mental disorder</dis> and on antipsychotic treatment. 
They were compared to a control group of 199 asthmatic patients not exposed to antipsychotic drugs. 
Data was extracted from the computerised clinical history ECAP in 2013.
Results
The mean age of the children was 12 years (8-17). 
Risperidone (67%) was the most frequent treatment. 
The recording of Body Mass Index (BMI) and blood pressure (AP) was 50% in <dis>Mental Disorder</dis> (<dis>MD</dis>) patients. 
A higher number of cardiovascular monitoring physical parameters (weight, height, BMI and BP) were observed in the <dis>MD</dis> group compared to the control Asthma control group. 
Altogether, more physical parameters than biochemistry parameters were recorded.
Conclusions
This study shows that the recording of cardiovascular parameters and metabolic studies needs to be improved in children and adolescents on treatment with antipsychotics.Introduction.
Depression is a common and <dis>disabling psychiatric disorder</dis> in adulthood and is associated with higher mortality and <dis>functional disability</dis>.

Objectives.
To determine the association between clinical and sociodemographic variables with depression in a sample of people over 50 years old living in Spain, and compare the prevalence of depression with the other Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement (SHARE) countries.

Material and methods.
There were 5,830 participants in the Spanish sample of the Wave 5, 2013, of SHARE. 
Tools used: EURO-D (Depression) and CASP-12 (Quality of Life). 
Statistical analysis: Bivariate, and binary logistic.

Results.
The variables associated with depression in the binary logistic regression (EURO-D ≥4) were poor self-perceived physical health (OR=13.34; 95% CI: 9.74-18.27), having more than 2 difficulties in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (OR=4.46; 95% CI: 3.13-6.34) and female gender (OR=2.16; 95% CI: 1.83-2.56). 
Depression was more common among participants with Alzheimer (76.4%), <dis>emotional disorders</dis> (73.9%), Parkinson (57.4%), hip fracture (55.4%), and rheumatism (50.9%). 
Compared with other European countries, Spain had a percentage of people with depression (29.3%) that was higher than the European average (27.9%).

Conclusions.
The most important variables associated with depression were poor perceived physical health, presence of difficulties in ADL, and female gender.
Introduction
The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for People with Learning Disabilities (HoNOS-LD) is a brief instrument that assesses functioning in people with <dis>intellectual development disorder</dis> and <dis>mental health problems</dis>/<dis>behaviour disorders</dis>. 
The aim of the present study was to examine the evidence on the validity of the scores based on the Spanish version of the HoNOS-LD.
Material and methods
The study included 111 participants that were assessed by the Spanish version of the HoNOS-LD and other questionnaires that measured different variables related to the scale. 
Thirty-three participants were assessed by 2 examiners, and retested 7 days later, in order to study inter-examiner reliability and test-retest reliabilities.
Results
Based on clinical and conceptual criteria, and on the results of the parallel analysis, a factorial solution with one factor was selected. 
Internal consistency was good (Omega coefficient of 0.87). 
Inter-examiner and test-retest reliabilities were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.98, respectively). 
Correlations between sections of the HoNOS-LD and the related instruments showed the expected direction, and were highly significant (P<.001), and the HoNOS-LD score increased with the intensity of the support required by the participants. 
These results showed evidence of the validity of association with other external variables.
Conclusions
The Spanish version of the HoNOS-LD is a brief, valid and reliable instrument, which will enable a routine assessment of functioning for different uses, including diagnosis and intervention.The immune system is a key element in the organism's defence system and participates in the maintenance of homeostasis. 
There is growing interest in the aetiopathogenic and prognostic implications of the immune system in <dis>mental disorders</dis>, as previous studies suggest the existence of a dysregulation of the immune response and a pro-inflammatory state in patients with <dis>mental disorders</dis>, as well as an increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases or receiving immune treatments. 
This study aims to conduct a narrative review of the scientific literature on the role of Psychoneuroimmunology in <dis>mental disorders</dis>, with special focus on diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic issues. 
The development of this body of knowledge may bring in the future important advances in the vulnerability, aetiopathogenic mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment of some <dis>mental disorders</dis>.Background
Little is published about the impact of the 2008 economic crisis on mental health services in Spain.
Method
An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to investigate a potential short-term association between the 2008 economic crisis and the number of psychiatric hospital admissions. 
The timing of the intervention (April 2008) was based on observed changes in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
Data on 1,152,880 psychiatric inpatients from the national Hospital Morbidity Survey, 69 months before and after the onset of the economic crisis (April 2008), were analyzed.
Results
Age-adjusted psychiatric (ICD9 290-319) hospital discharge rates significantly increased from April 2008, matching the onset of the crisis, especially for inpatients aged 15-24 years old and to a less extend for inpatients aged 25-34 years old. 
Other age groups were not affected. 
There was a significant increase in diagnoses for <dis>disturbance of conduct and emotions</dis>, depression, <dis>neurotic and personality disorders</dis> and alcohol and drug disorders; however, diagnoses for <dis>mental retardation</dis> and organic psychosis for 15-34 years old inpatients were unaffected.
Conclusions
Psychiatric hospital admissions abruptly increased in April 2008, coinciding with the onset of the economic crisis. 
We identified age groups and diagnoses affected. 
Increased hospitalizations were found only at the age-ranges most affected by the rise in unemployment. 
The diagnoses affected were those most sensitive to environmental changes.We report the case of a 58-year old male patient who in the last month had two drop attacks with strength loss in both upper and lower left limbs; the patient had <dis>dysarthria</dis> and the clinical picture resolved spontaneously.
He was diagnosed ot transient ischemic attacks (TIA).
He had no cardiovascular risk factors and blood pressure was normal.
After a specific neurological investigation and study of the possible etiology or risk factors no evidence was observed.
A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed and the white coat normotension phenomenon was observed as the likely risk factor for the attack.
The prevalence, diagnosis, reproducibility, association with other variables and its clinical significance are analyzed.Abstract
 Objective
To determine the prevalence of <dis>dementias</dis> in individuals over 65 years old and their relationship with sex and age.
Material and methods
A descriptive study of prevalence was conducted on the population of Trobajo del Camino (Trobajo-Valverde Health Centre), belonging to the municipality of San Andrés del Rabanedo in the Province of Leon.
The medical records of all patients over 65 years were reviewed.
Those who had been given a diagnosis of any type of <dis>dementia</dis> were recorded.
The study included 9603 inhabitants, of which 1542 were at least 65 years of age, and formed the sample of this study.
This sample (869 women and 673 men) was 16.1% of the total population studied.
Results
The prevalence of <dis>dementias</dis> in over 65 year-olds was 4.9%, and was directly proportional with age.
The disease was more prevalent in women (5.6%).
The most frequent type was Alzheimer disease (2.6%), and the least frequent was progressive supranuclear palsy (0.1%).
Conclusions
The prevalence of <dis>dementias</dis> was around 5% in the population over 65 years.
A directly proportional relationship with age was obtained, and was more prevalent in women.Abstract
 <dis>Cognitive impairment</dis> is defined as a newly appeared deficit in at least two areas of cognitive functions, including <dis>disturbances in memory, executive functioning, attention or speed of information processing, perceptual motor abilities, or language</dis>.
<dis>Cognitive impairment</dis> is highly prevalent in ESRD patients when compared with the general population.
It has also been associated with a decreased quality of life.
Cognitive functions in patients with ESRD showed improvement with dialysis and renal transplantation.
These findings illustrate the potential importance of evaluating and comparing the effects of hemodialysis and transplantation regarding cognitive performance and thus quality of life in ESRD patients and normal subjects.
This study was carried out in 100 patients (50 ESRD patients on regular hemodialysis for at least 6 months and 50 post-transplant patients who had maintained successful kidney graft for at least 3 months).
All patients underwent laboratory and psychometric scoring tests, including trail making test part A, trail making test part B, digit span, and mini-mental state examination.
Thirty healthy adults matched by age and sex served as a control group.
The results showed significant differences in cognitive function tests results between transplant and hemodialysis patients ( _P_ < 0.01), suggesting that transplant patients were superior in their cognitive performance, with the correction of anemia being the most important factor for improving cognitive performance in both groups.
There were no significant differences between transplant patients and control subjects in psychometric measures ( _P_ > 0.05).
Conclusion
Renal transplantation as a modality of treatment, in ESRD patients, is superior to hemodialysis in terms of cognitive performance improvement.Abstract
 Introduction
The impact of Parkinson's Disease (PD) on patients and their caregivers severely affects their quality of life.
There is no curative treatment.
Treatment is aimed at symptomatic control.
Comprehensive care is required to improve their quality of life and achieve maximum independence.
Objectives
To describe the experience in the surgical treatment for PD at the Albacete University Hospital (Spain) 2007–2010, to assess the quality of life of the patient with PD after brain stimulation, and to determine the level of patient satisfaction.
Material and method
Longitudinal observational descriptive study, collecting demographic data, age at onset, years of evolution, quality of life before and after surgical treatment, level of satisfaction, post-surgical complications and clinical evolution, using the PDQ-39 questionnaire, a satisfaction questionnaire, a review of clinical records and an interview with the neuro-surgical team.
Results
A total of 13 patients received surgical treatment.
A total of 90.9% of patients were satisfied after the surgery, and 81.9% with their quality of life.
There was a notable improvement in mobility, AVD and emotional well- being, but was worse in the assessment as regards the social support they receive and with <dis>cognitive impairment and communication</dis>.
Conclusions
A clinical improvement was achieved in patients with surgical treatment, including reducing motor symptoms, <dis>dyskinesias</dis> and fluctuations, by facilitating the performing of activities of daily life (ADL) and improving their quality of life.
Patient are satisfied with their quality of life, but the need to enhance the psychosocial support they receive is detected.Abstract
 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder presenting with <dis>rapidly progressive memory impairment</dis>, behavioral changes, lack of coordination and/or <dis>visual disturbances</dis>.
This condition is part of a group of diseases known as spongiform encephalopathies or prionic diseases, which are caused by accumulation of a pathological prion protein (PrP) in the central nervous system, and may occur in sporadic, hereditary or acquired form.
Symptoms usually begin around 60-70 years old and, as the disease advances, progressive neuronal damage due to PrP deposits leads to a more pronounced <dis>mental deterioration</dis>, appearance of <dis>movement disorders</dis>, <dis>blindness</dis> and coma, reaching a high mortality rate (90%) within first year.
We present a case of a 65 year-old woman who came to the emergency room complaining of <dis>progressive language disturbance</dis> and abnormal posture of her right arm that had begun one month earlier.
After detailed clinical and neuropsychological examinations CJD was suspected and complementary examinations such as EEG, brain MRI and lumbar puncture were performed.
The patient showed <dis>rapid and global cognitive deterioration</dis>, leading to her death two months after admission.
A subsequent pathological study confirmed the diagnosis of CJD.
It is important to know the disease in order to provide adequate nursing care.
The rapid progression of the disease and the level of dependence make it necessary to continually reappraise these patients.Abstract
 Marchiafava Bignami disease is a rare encephalopathy characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum, with the subsequent atrophy.
It is usually caused by a chronic abuse of alcohol, although it may also have an idiopathic origin or be related to nutritional deficiencies.
It is most frequently seen in middle-aged men with an alcoholism problem (40 to 60 years old), but it has also been described in non-alcoholic men and in females.
Symptoms can show several degrees of mental confusion, <dis>lack of memory</dis>, <dis>impairment of certain cognitive and emotional functions</dis>, signs of inter- hemispheric disconnection, <dis>dysarthria</dis> and <dis>gait impairment</dis>.
The case is presented of a 47-year-old male patient who came to the emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness and <dis>language impairment</dis>.
After discarding several diagnoses and performing various tests, the MRI showed a hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum, consistent with the diagnosis of Marchifava Bignami disease It is important to be aware of this disease for the proper approach by nurses in order to provide good quality care.Abstract
 Introduction
The emotional sphere and its relationships with sexual identity and awareness of disability in a person with Down syndrome (DS).
Case report
25-year-old woman with DS who has a psychotic episode with delusions when a tubal ligation is being considered.
The condition arises due to a conflict between sexuality and identity.
Discussion
People with Down's syndrome can undergo unharmonious development or remain anchored in previous evolutionary stages.
This situation, together with difficulties to symbolise, can lead to <dis>psychotic mental disorders</dis>, as in this case.Abstract
 People with <dis>severe mental illnesses</dis>, such as schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder, have worse physical health and reduced life expectancy compared to the general population.
The excess cardiovascular mortality associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is attributed to an increased risk of the modifiable coronary heart disease risk factors, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.
Antipsychotic medication and possibly other psychotropic medication like antidepressants can induce weight gain and further increase the risk of adverse metabolic effects which may result in further increased incidence of cardiovascular disease.
Patients have limited access to general healthcare with less opportunity for cardiovascular risk screening and prevention than would be expected in a non- psychiatric population.
The European Psychiatric Association (EPA), supported by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published this statement aiming to improve the care of patients suffering from <dis>severe mental illness</dis>.
The intention is to initiate co-operation and shared care between the different health care professionals and to increase the awareness of psychiatrists caring for patients suffering from <dis>severe mental illness</dis> to screen and treat increased cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes.Abstract
 Introduction and objectives
The activity of behavioral inhibition and activation systems (BIS and BAS) has been related to several <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
The availability of a validated questionnaire to assess BIS and BAS over the telephone could aid research.
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the procedural validity of telephone administration of the sensitivity to punishment/sensitivity to reward questionnaire (SPSRQ) as a measure of BIS and BAS activity (by means of its two scales: the sensitivity to punishment [SP] scale and the sensitivity to reward [SR] scale).
Methods
A total of 231 participants were assessed with the SPSRQ twice (over the telephone and in a self-administered format).
Intraclass correlation coefficients and kappa indices were calculated.
Additionally, possible differences between the mean scores obtained with the two assessment procedures and internal consistency were explored.
Results
Telephone and self-assessment of BIS and BAS, by means of the SPSRQ, provided similar results, supporting the procedural validity of telephone administration.
A slight but statistically significant tendency (estimated betha = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.33–0.92; p < 0.001) toward lower scores was observed for the telephone-administered SP scale and for the interaction “first or second assessment/telephone or self-administered SPSRQ” for the SR scale (p = 0.023).
Conclusions
The results of the present study support the reliability of telephone assessment of BIS and BAS by means of the SPSRQ.Abstract
 There is growing acceptance that pregnancy itself is not a protective factor against <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
Indeed, some <dis>mental disorders</dis> such as psychotic and bipolar disorders may become worse during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period.
In pregnant women with a <dis>mental disorder</dis> that can be treated with antipsychotics, the known risks—teratogenic, obstetric, neonatal and those affecting the mother— indicate that, in general, the risk of the non-treated disorder is higher than that resulting from the use of antipsychotics and that the reduction in psychoticism improves the overall prognosis of these women.
All the antipsychotics marketed in Spain are included in category C of the US Food and Drug Administration, with the exception of clozapine and piperazine, which are included in category B.
The use of all of these drugs should be avoided during breast feeding as far as possible.
The most reliable current recommendations indicate that optimal control of <dis>severe mental disorders</dis> should be maintained during pregnancy, the postpartum and subsequent periods.
These recommendations also indicate that women with <dis>mental disorders</dis> must be considered as high risk and that both these women and their pregnancies should be constantly monitored.
The currently available scientific information does not allow more than relatively secure individually-tailored recommendations to be made.
When taking the decision of whether or not to treat with antipsychotics, the use of a risk- benefit relationship is crucial, with the participation of the woman's partner or legal representative, other physicians and even the clinical pharmacist if necessary.Abstract
 Introduction
The aim of this study was to evaluate discontinuation of quetiapine treatment in adolescents (12–18 years) in a 6-month naturalistic follow-up study and to assess the influence of distinct demographic and clinical factors on quetiapine discontinuation.
Material and methods
We performed a naturalistic 6-month follow-up study in 61 antipsychotic-naïve patients [39 boys (64%)] who initiated quetiapine treatment.
The dependent variable was treatment discontinuation for any cause (continuation/discontinuation was a dichotomic variable).
The independent variables were age, gender, race, duration of <dis>mental illness</dis>, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score at treatment initiation, adverse effects in the first 16 days of treatment, the presence of involuntary movements before starting treatment, and abusive consumption or toxic dependency.
Results
Of the 61 patients participating in the study, 42 (68.9%) complied with quetiapine treatment for 6 months, while 19 (31.1%) discontinued the treatment (for any cause).
The presence of Parkinson-like symptoms before starting treatment was a risk factor for discontinuation (Hazard ratio=8.3, _P_ =.007).
Conclusions
Continuation/discontinuation of quetiapine was influenced by the presence of motor symptoms before treatment initiation, which therefore affected the patient's overall prognosis.
Consequently, we recommend that the presence of motor symptoms be evaluated before treatment with antipsychotic drugs is started.Abstract
 Introduction
The study of administrative prevalence from cumulative psychiatric case registers allows the mental health state of the studied region and the functioning of its Health Services to be estimated.
Methods
Data were extracted from the Asturias Cumulative Psychiatric Case Register (RACPAS) between January 1st 1998 and December 3rd 2010.
Characteristics of the population of the catchment area were studied, and their relationship with the administrative prevalence was analysed.
Results
The mean population in the studied period was 1,078,406 inhabitants.
The Fritz index and the Youth and replacement indices of the active population decreased throughout the period.
There was no significant increase in the prevalence of <dis>organic mental disorders</dis>, psychosis, mood disorders, and substance use in males, or <dis>behavioural disorders</dis> associated with somatic factors and physiological dysfunctions in females.
There were significant gender differences in the prevalence of all disorders, except for <dis>personality disorders</dis> and <dis>organic mental disorders</dis>.
Population ageing had a significant influence on the increase in the prevalence of most <dis>mental disorders</dis> in both males and females.
Conclusions
A slight general increase in the administrative prevalence of <dis>mental disorders</dis> is observed during the studied period, and it was influenced by population ageing.Intralabyrinthine schwannomas are uncommon tumours that arise from neural elements in distal branches of the 8th cranial nerve thus they are confined to or have arisen from the vestibule, the semi-circular canals, or the cochlea.
The most common presenting symptom is <dis>progressive sensory neural hearing loss with or without tinnitus and vestibular symptoms</dis>.
The diagnostic procedure of choice is gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
Most of these patients can be managed with observation.
The indications for surgery are limited.
We present 2 patients with a diagnosis of intralabyrinthine schwannoma.
A discussion of the management of the intralabyrinthine schwannoma follows.There are many different vertigo classifications and different denominations are frequently used for the same clinical processes.
The Otoneurology Committee of the Spanish Society for Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Pathology proposes an eminently practical classification of peripheral vertigo to facilitate a common terminology that can be easily used by general ENT practitioners.
The methodology used has been by consensus within our society and especially among the most outstanding work groups in the area of otoneurology in Spain.
Initially vertigo is divided into single-episode vertigo and recurring attacks of vertigo, and these are then sub-divided into 2 groups, depending on whether or not <dis>hearing loss</dis> is present.
Acute vertigo <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>hearing loss</dis></scp> corresponds to vestibular neuritis and if it is associated with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, it is due to labyrinthitis of different aetiologies and cochleovestibular neuritis.
Recurrent vertigos <scp><neg>without</neg> <dis>hearing loss</dis></scp> are classified as induced, either by posture (BPPV) or pressure (perilymphatic fistula), or as spontaneous, including migraine-associated vertigo, metabolic vertigo, childhood paroxysmal vertigo, and vertigo of vascular causes (TIAs, vertebrobasilar insufficiency).
Finally, recurrent vertigo with <dis>hearing loss</dis> includes Ménière's disease and others such as vertigomigraine (with <dis>hearing loss</dis>), autoimmune pathology of the inner ear, syphilitic infection, and perilymphatic fistula (with <dis>hearing loss</dis>).Abstract
 The aim of this study is evaluate the unusual ways of initial presentation of the vestibular schwannomas.
We performed a retrospective study of the patients who underwent resection of acoustic neuromas in our service, including for analysis only the cases which initial symptom was <scp><neg>not</neg> the <dis>hearing loss</dis></scp>.
Tumour size, localization, clinical presentation, and age of the patients were considered.
Nine patients present with atypical symptoms.
The most common complain in this group were facial paresthesias (22.2%).
None of them complained about other otological symptoms.
Asignificant group of patients did not present with the otological symptoms classically associated with vestibular schwannoma.
Clinical knowledge of these kinds of symptoms may lead to earlier detection of these lesions.Abstract
 Objective
To identify and describe <dis>peripheral and central audiological abnormalities</dis> of patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.
Materials and methods
Prospective, cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study.
Vogt-Koyanagi- Harada patients referred from an ophthalmologic centre were assessed for signs and symptoms of auditory pathology.
Peripheral audiological and central auditory processing tests were performed.
To standardize the latter, methodological controls were matched for sex, age and audiometric chart.
Results
Twenty-one patients were included (3 male, 18 female); mean age, 40.7 (11.82) years.
Nine of the 21 complained of tinnitus and 9 suspected <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
Exclusively or mainly sensorial abnormalities on the pure tone audiometry chart were documented in 61.9% (mainly selective troughs at 4 and 8 kHz); 95.3% of patients had deficit in high-frequency audiometry.
Five of the patients had <dis>sensorial disorders</dis> in the speech audiometry.
No central auditory processing disorder was seen.
Conclusions
Most of the patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome had <dis>objective peripheral audiological abnormalities</dis>, although few revealed any symptoms.Abstract
 Introduction and objective
To determine the clinical and audiological behaviour per age group in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS), considering that it is the second most frequent autoimmune rheumatic disease.
Material and method
The study included 29 patients with SS with clinical history and audiological studies.
The design was prospective, descriptive and transversal.
Results
Average patient age was 41 years.
All the patients with <dis>hearing loss</dis> in conventional tone audiometry were of the sensory type.
At high frequencies, 66% of the patients did not respond at 20 KHz, and 48% at the frequency of 16 KHz.
In logoaudiometry and impedancemetry, the results were the ones expected for the auditory thresholds.
Conclusions
Auditory damage related to SS is located in the inner ear.
Patients must be informed by their physician of the risk of having auditory damage as a complication of the disease.
Audiological evaluation must be performed periodically to identify possible audiological damage.Abstract
 Introduction
Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is the commonest congenital anomaly found with imaging techniques in <dis>paediatric sensorineural hearing loss</dis> (<dis>SNHL</dis>).
Our aim was to describe clinical and audiological findings in <dis>paediatric hearing loss</dis> associated to EVA.
Methods
Retrospective review of 55 children with imaging-technique EVA findings from 2000 to 2009.
Subjective and/or objective audiological tests were analysed and audiological findings related to clinical features were described.
Results
Thirty-seven patients (67.27%) showed bilateral EVA and 18 (32.72%) were unilateral.
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> was bilateral in 46 (83.63%) patients and unilateral in 9 (16.36%).
Mean age at diagnosis was 3.78 years.
Fifty-three (96.36%) children showed <dis>SNHL</dis> (28 bilateral and profound), while 2 (3.63%) patients had <dis>mixed hearing loss</dis>.
There were 3 cases of <dis>hearing loss progression</dis>, 2 fluctuations, 2 of them were asymmetric and 2 patients suffered from vestibular symptoms.
Concomitant image findings were 6 cochlear hypoplasia, 2 enlarged internal auditory canals, 1 enlarged vestibule and 1 hypoplastic lateral semicircular canal.
Six clinical syndromes were found (2 cases of Down's, and 1 each of Jacobsen, Pendred, Waardenburg and branchio-otorenal).
One child was positive for GJB2 mutation.
<dis>Familial hearing loss</dis> was demonstrated on 12 (21.8%) cases.
Conclusion
The clinical picture of <dis>hearing loss</dis> associated to EVA is characterised by great variability.
It should be included in the differential diagnosis of <dis>unexplained mixed hearing loss</dis>.
Familial and syndromic findings have to be taken into consideration in the diagnostic evaluations of such patients.
Knowledge about the natural history of this illness is needed so as to give parents prognostic information.Abstract
 Introduction
Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of systemic diseases characterised by a genetic deficiency of lysosomal enzymes that cause the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in different tissues.
The onset of symptoms usually occurs in early childhood, causing problems of otitis media, <dis>hearing loss</dis> and airway obstruction in the ENT area.
Objective
Describing the audiological findings and airway pathology found in 9 children diagnosed as having MPS.
Methods
A retrospective review was performed of the clinical and audiological findings, exploratory results and therapeutic ENT procedures for 9 children diagnosed with MPS in an ENT service at a tertiary paediatric public centre in the period 2007–2010.
Results
Subtypes found were 4 MPS type I, 2 moderate MPS type II, 1 severe MPS type II, 1 MPS type IV and 1 MPS type VI.
All patients presented chronic middle ear effusions.
A child developed <dis>mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</dis>; another case was diagnosed as <dis>mixed hearing loss</dis>.
The remaining auditory pattern was <dis>moderate bilateral conductive hearing loss</dis>.
Four patients showed secondary obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) due to Waldeyer ring hyperplasia; surgery could not be performed on one of them because of cervical spinal cord compression from mucopolysaccharide deposits.
In 2 cases, there was OSAHS relapse.
Conclusions
Children with MPS are at increased risk for developing <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
The OSAHS syndrome appears in greater proportion than in the general child population, and recurrences may occur more frequently after surgery.
Such children can also be risk patients in airway management.Abstract
 In the last decade, tremendous progress has been made very rapidly in the development of Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) systems as a major public health initiative.
The percentage of infants screened annually in Spain has increased significantly since the EHDI systems have expanded to all autonomic regions.
Historically, high risk indicators have been used for the identification of infants who should receive audiological evaluation but who live in geographic locations where universal hearing screening is not yet available, to help identify infants who pass neonatal screening but are at risk of developing <dis>delayed-onset hearing loss</dis> and to identify infants who may have passed neonatal screening but have <dis>mild forms of permanent hearing loss</dis>.
In this review, the standard risk factors for <dis>hearing loss</dis> are analysed and the risk factors known to be associated with <dis>late onset or progressive hearing loss</dis> are identified.
The recommendation for infants with a risk factor that may be considered as low risk is to perform at least one audiology assessment in 24–30 months.
In contrast, for an infant with risk factors known to be associated with <dis>late onset or progressive hearing loss</dis> (such as cytomegalovirus infection or family history), early and more frequent assessment is appropriate.
All infants should have an objective standardised screening of global development with a validated assessment tool at 9, 18 and 24–30 months of age or at any time if the health care professional or the family is concerned.Abstract
 Introduction and objectives
To assess the improvement of quality of life in osseointegrated implanted patients, taking into account the indication as well as the use of the implant, and the presence of pre- and postoperative tinnitus.
Methods
Sixty-nine patients implanted between June 2004 and November 2010 were included.
The average age of the patients was 40 years.
The instruments used to quantify the change in quality of life were the Glasgow Benefit Inventory and a questionnaire including open questions, bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) use, change in tinnitus and postoperative pain.
Results
The average total benefit score with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory was 38, and the general, social, and physical scores were 51, 15 and 7, respectively.
There was no significant association between sex, age and bilaterality or unilaterality of the process with quality of life.
Nevertheless, there were significantly better results in patients with <dis>conductive hearing loss</dis> than in those with <dis>unilateral deafness</dis>, and the results were positive although in both groups.
The tinnitus rate went from 37.5 to 20.8% following BAHA, with this difference being significant.
Conclusions
Our results show that the use of BAHA is associated with a great improvement in quality of life for patients with <dis>conductive hearing loss</dis>, whereas indications in <dis>unilateral deafness</dis> have to be individually studied.
Moreover, the study shows that BAHA has a positive effect upon tinnitus.Abstract
 Introduction and objective
Hearing plays an essential role in the acquisition, development and maintenance of the properties of the speech and language.
Birth weight is an indicator of biological maturation of the newborn.
Premature newborns with very low birth weight (VLBW<1500 g) constitute a group with the highest risk of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>.
Our objective was to ascertain the degree of <dis>hearing loss</dis>, <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> and presence of the association to other risk factors for <dis>hearing loss</dis> in VLBW infants included in the Universal Hearing Loss Screening Programme at the University Mother-Child Hospital of Gran Canaria (Spain) in the 2007–2010 period.
Material and methods
This was a retrospective study of 364 infants with VLBW, measured by transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response.
Results
There were 112 newborns (30.8%) referred for auditory brainstem response.
A diagnosis of <dis>hearing loss</dis> was given to 22 newborns (2.2%), 14 had <dis>conductive hearing loss</dis> and 8, <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> (<dis>SNHL</dis>), of which 2 had <dis>bilateral profound hearing loss</dis>.
The VLBW newborns presented the association to another risk factor in more than a quarter of the sample studied.
All those diagnosed with <dis>SNHL</dis> were premature.
Conclusions
The percentage of VLBW newborns diagnosed with <dis>hearing loss</dis> is higher than expected in the general population.
All those diagnosed with <dis>SNHL</dis> were premature and presented one or 2 hearing risk factors associated with VLBW.Abstract
 Introduction and objectives
Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic immune-mediated vasculitis of unknown origin characterised by recurrent orogenital ulceration, ocular inflammation and skin lesions.
The aim of our study was to identify ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations associated with BD.
Patients and methods
Retrospective review of the medical records of all patients diagnosed with BD who attended a tertiary public hospital in Cantabria (Spain) over a period of 22 years.
Clinical manifestations, in particular those concerning ENT, were retrieved from medical records.
A medical literature review of ENT manifestations was conducted.
Results
Thirty-three patients (age range: 17–64 years) were included in the study.
Most of them presented oral ulcers (97%).
Eight patients (24%) presented oropharyngeal ulcers and 5 patients (15%) experienced audiovestibular symptoms (high frequency <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, vertigo and bilateral vestibular hypofunction).
One patient had symptoms compatible with vestibular neuronitis as the presentation manifestation of Neuro-Behçet.
In 4 patients (12%) the presence of odynophagia secondary to the presence of oropharyngeal lesions, initially interpreted as acute or recurrent tonsillitis, was the first manifestation of the disease, alone or associated with cutaneous or ocular lesions.
Conclusions
In addition to the characteristic oral ulcers present in most patients with BD, ulcers in the oropharynx, occasionally interpreted as acute pharyngitis, are also common in these patients.
Audiovestibular manifestations frequently appear during the course of the disease and may be the first symptom of central nervous system involvement.Abstract
 The latest scientific literature considers early diagnosis of <dis>deafness</dis> as the key element to define the educational and inclusive prognosis of the <dis>deaf</dis> child, because it allows taking advantage of the critical period of development (0–4 years).
Highly significant differences exist between <dis>deaf</dis> people who have been stimulated early and those who have received late or improper intervention.
Early identification of late-onset disorders requires special attention and knowledge on the part of every childcare professional.
Programmes and additional actions beyond neonatal screening should be designed and planned to ensure that every child with a <dis>significant hearing loss</dis> is detected early.
For this purpose, the CODEPEH would like to highlight the need for continuous monitoring of children's auditory health.
Consequently, CODEPEH has drafted the recommendations included in the present document.Abstract
 Introduction
Despite its importance, the existence of false negatives (patients who are told they hear well, but they have some degree of hipacusia) is rarely evaluated in programmes for early detection of <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
The aim of this study is to determine the variables that can lead to a delayed diagnosis, especially the existence of false negatives and the lack of registration of risk factors.
Methods
A retrospective study of prevalence has been carried out, in which the medical records of children diagnosed with <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> born within 2005 and 2012 in the health centres of study have been analysed.
Results
Of the 32 children with <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, 16 passed the OAE, 12 did not passed the OAE, and in four they were not carried out.
Of the children who passed the OAE, 57% have <dis>severe hearing loss</dis>.
66% of children with <dis>hearing loss</dis> presented a risk factor for <dis>hearing loss</dis> at birth, being the most frecuent family history of <dis>hearing loss</dis>, but only 7% of those with family history of <dis>hearing loss</dis> were included in the risk group.
Conclusions
The results of the study indicate that the late diagnosis of <dis>hearing loss</dis> is related to the presence of false negatives to the OAE and the non-registration of risk factors.Abstract
 Introduction
The aim of this study was to determine the impact that the cochlear implant (CI) had in the working life of individuals implanted, using the first version of a questionnaire developed in the cochlear implant program at the University Clinic of Navarre.
Its purpose was to demonstrate that the CI significantly affected the working lives of these patients.
Material and methods
This was a retrospection study on a population of 60 patients (mean age, 48 years old) with <dis>bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss</dis> treated with CI and to whom a questionnaire on working life satisfaction was given.
Results
Of the patients completing the questionnaire, 94.23% were currently satisfied at work.
Almost all of them (93.05%) were more motivated to go to work after the implantation.
The majority (79.31%) considered themselves more competent after surgery and device activation.
Social relations at work were considered to have improved after cochlear implantation by 67.23% of patients.
Conclusions
The CI provided positive support in the professional sphere as well as in social abilities by improving communication skills of implanted patients.
The development of tools to assess the degree of job satisfaction of patients treated with a CI is of great interest.Abstract
 Introduction and objective
Sixty percent of <dis>prelingual hearing loss</dis> is of genetic origin.
A family history of <dis>permanent childhood hearing loss</dis> is a risk factor.
The objective of the study is to determine the relationship between this risk factor and <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
We have evaluated clinical and epidemiological characteristics and related nonsyndromic genetic variation.
Material and method
This was a retrospective, descriptive and observational study of newborns between January 2007 and December 2010 with family history as risk factor for <dis>hearing loss</dis> using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response.
Results
A total of 26,717 children were born.
Eight hundred and fifty-seven (3.2%) had family history.
Fifty-seven (0.21%) failed to pass the second test.
A percentage of 29.1 (n=16) had another risk factor, and 17.8% (n=9) had no classical risk factor.
No risk factor was related to the <dis>hearing loss</dis> except heart disease.
Seventy-six point four percent had normal hearing and 23.6% <dis>hearing loss</dis>.
The mean of family members with <dis>hearing loss</dis> was 1.25.
On genetic testing, 82.86% of homozygotes was normal, 11.43% heterozygosity in Connexin 26 gene (35delG), 2.86% R143W heterozygosity in the same gene and 2.86% mutant homozygotes (35delG).
We found no relationship between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and mutated allele.
Conclusions
The percentage of children with a family history and <dis>hearing loss</dis> is higher than expected in the general population.
The genetic profile requires updating to clarify the relationship between <dis>hearing loss</dis> and heart disease, family history and the low prevalence in the mutations analyzed.Abstract
 Case report
A case is presented of a 30-year-old male with ichthyosis, <dis>mental retardation</dis>, epilepsy and spasticity.
Ocular examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 0.5 and bilateral crystalline maculopathy.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed focal hyperreflective spots and intrafoveal microcystoid spaces.
The diagnosis of Sjögren–Larsson syndrome (SLS) was made, and confirmed by genetic analysis.
Discussion
SLS is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene.
A previously unreported novel mutation was identified, c. 681–14T > G. Macular OCT makes it possible to find even funduscopy invisible changes.
Its use is important because the OCT features of SLS are specific and, therefore, it can help to diagnose this rare systemic disease.Abstract
 Introduction
The <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis> are group of conditions characterised by <dis>qualitative impairments in social communication</dis>; in the interaction and imagination; with a restricted range of interests and stereotyped repetitive behaviours.
Frequently, there is a delay in the age of detection, and therefore in starting multidisciplinary evaluations and interventions, which may result in a worst prognosis and an impaired quality of life for both children and parents.
The aim of our study was to describe some clinical and epidemiological data including the age of detection and main initial complaints present in children with <dis>autism disorders</dis> from a paediatric neurology centre.
Patients and methods
A total of 393 medical records of consecutive cases with a diagnosis of <dis>autism spectrum disorders</dis> were reviewed.
Results
<dis>Autism</dis> was diagnosed in 82.1% of the cases, unspecified pervasive disorder in 9.9%, and Asperger syndrome in 4.8%.
Sixty percent of <dis>autistic</dis> children presented with a <dis>language disorder</dis> as their main complaint.
The average age of detection was 4 years.
Conclusions
Compared with other countries, age of detection is delayed.
A Primary Care based screening and surveillance are required in order to improve prognosis and quality of life of children with an <dis>Autism Spectrum Disorder</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Primary progressive aphasia</dis> (<dis>PPA</dis>) is a clinical syndrome characterised by a <dis>progressive decline in language and speech of neurodegenerative origin</dis>.
Major breakthroughs made in recent years have lent us a better understanding of this syndrome, which may be the first manifestation of any of a number of neurodegenerative diseases.
Development
We reviewed the main aspects of <dis>PPA</dis> epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, aetiology and treatment.
Most cases manifest sporadically and the typical age of onset is between 50 and 70 years.
Three clinically distinct variants have been described: <dis>nonfluent or agrammatic PPA</dis>, <dis>semantic PPA</dis> and <dis>logopenic PPA</dis>.
Each of these variants tends to be associated with specific histopathological findings, but clinical diagnostic methods are imperfect predictors of underlying pathology.
Anatomical and functional neuroimaging can provide useful biomarkers.
Several treatments have been proposed, and while no clear benefits have been demonstrated, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be useful, especially in the logopenic variant.
Conclusions
PPA is an emerging syndrome which may be more prevalent than we might expect.
It was previously listed as part of the <dis>frontotemporal dementia spectrum</dis>, and it is also related to Alzheimer disease.
Clinical diagnosis, complemented by a biomarker evaluation, may predict the underlying pathology, which in turn will improve treatment possibilities.Abstract
 Introduction
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is one of the most frequent neurocutaneous disorders.
Cortical tubers are the most common pathological changes in TSC and they are directly related to the disease's main clinical manifestations: seizures, <dis>mental retardation</dis>, and <dis>autistic behaviour</dis>.
Objective
The aim of this study is to establish a correlation between tuber size and the severity of clinical features in TSC.
Material and methods
We performed a retrospective study of the clinical and imaging findings from 45 TSC patients (22 females and 23 males) and compared the clinical features with the location, size, and number of the cortical tubers in each patient.
Results
Four patients had voluminous tubers located in 1 or both cerebral hemispheres.
All of these patients had intractable seizures and <dis>severe mental retardation</dis>; 3 of these cases also presented with <dis>autistic behaviour</dis>, despite tubers having been resected in all 4 patients.
Thirteen patients had tubers of large-to- average size, and all patients in this group showed intractable seizures and <dis>mental retardation</dis>.
Nine patients who had experienced infantile spasms during the first year of life presented <dis>autistic behaviour</dis>.
Multiple tubers of small to average size were found in 28 patients.
In general, this group had seizures that responded well to antiepileptic drugs and a low prevalence of <dis>autism</dis>.
In 3 patients who all presented good seizure control and normal intelligence, single cortical/subcortical tubers were located in the frontal or occipital lobes.
Of the total of 45 patients, 13 had cerebellar as well as cerebral tubers; these were generally present in cases with more severe clinical features.
Conclusions
Although large tubers are less common than small to medium-sized ones, they are much more likely to be accompanied by severe clinical symptoms (seizures, <dis>mental retardation</dis> and <dis>autistic behaviour</dis>), even when the smaller tubers are quite numerous.Abstract
 Introduction
Some treatments are inappropriate for patients with <dis>cognitive decline</dis>.
We analyse their use in 500 patients and present a literature review.
Development
Benzodiazepines produce dependence, and reduce attention, memory, and motor ability.
They can cause disinhibition or aggressive behaviour, facilitate the appearance of delirium, and increase accident and mortality rates in people older than 60.
In subjects over 65, low systolic blood pressure is associated with <dis>cognitive decline</dis>.
Maintaining this figure between 130 and 140 mmHg (145 in patients older than 80) is recommended.
Hypocholesterolaemia < 160 mg/dL is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, aggressiveness, and suicide; high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol < 40 mg/dL is associated with <dis>memory loss</dis> and increased vascular and mortality risks.
Old age is a predisposing factor for developing <dis>cognitive disorders</dis> or delirium when taking opioids.
The risks of prescribing anticholinesterases and memantine to patients with <dis>non-Alzheimer dementia</dis> that is not associated with Parkinson disease, <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>, or <dis>psychiatric disorders</dis> probably outweigh the benefits.
Anticholinergic drugs acting preferentially on the peripheral system can also induce cognitive side effects.
Practitioners should be aware of <dis>steroid-induced dementia</dis> and steroid-induced psychosis, and know that risk of delirium increases with polypharmacy.
Of 500 patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, 70.4% were on multiple medications and 42% were taking benzodiazepines.
Both conditions were present in 74.3% of all suspected iatrogenic cases.
Conclusions
Polypharmacy should be avoided, if it is not essential, especially in elderly patients and those with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.
Benzodiazepines, opioids and anticholinergics often elicit <dis>cognitive and behavioural disorders</dis>.
Moreover, systolic blood pressure must be kept above 130 mmHg, total cholesterol levels over 160 mg/dL, and HDL-cholesterol over 40 mg/dL in this population.Abstract
 In the context of the limitations of structural imaging, brain perfusion and metabolism using SPECT and PET have provided relevant information for the study of <dis>cognitive decline</dis>.
The introduction of the radiotracers for cerebral amyloid imaging has changed the diagnostic strategy regarding Alzheimer's disease, which is currently considered to be a «continuum».
According to this new paradigm, the increasing amyloid load would be associated to the preclinical phase and <dis>mild cognitive impairment</dis>.
It has been possible to observe «in vivo» images using 11C-PIB and PET scans.
The characteristics of the 11C-PIB image include specific high brain cortical area retention in the positive cases with typical distribution pattern and no retention in the negative cases.
This, in combination with 18F-FDG PET, is the basis of molecular neuroimaging as a biomarker.
At present, its prognostic value is being evaluated in longitudinal studies.
11C-PIB-PET has become the reference radiotracer to evaluate the presence of cerebral amyloid.
However, its availability is limited due to the need for a nearby cyclotron.
Therefore, 18F labeled radiotracers are being introduced.
Our experience in the last two years with 11C-PIB, first in the research phase and then as being clinically applied, has shown the utility of the technique in the clinical field, either alone or in combination with FDG.
Thus, amyloid image is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of <dis>dementia</dis> and it is a potentially useful method for early diagnosis and evaluation of future treatments.
Abstract
 Objective
To determine the status of neuroimaging studies of Nuclear Medicine in Spain during 2013 and first quarter of 2014, in order to define the activities of the neuroimaging group of the Spanish Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SEMNIM).
Material and methods
A questionnaire of 14 questions was designed, divided into 3 parts: characteristics of the departments (equipment and professionals involved); type of scans and clinical indications; and evaluation methods.
The questionnaire was sent to 166 Nuclear Medicine departments.
Results
A total of 54 departments distributed among all regions completed the questionnaire.
Most departments performed between 300 and 800 neuroimaging examinations per year, representing more than 25 scans per month.
The average pieces of equipment were three; half of the departments had a PET/CT scanner and SPECT/CT equipment.
Scans performed more frequently were brain SPECT with 123I-FP-CIT, followed by brain perfusion SPECT and PET with 18F-FDG.
The most frequent clinical indications were <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> followed by <dis>movement disorders</dis>.
For evaluation of the images most sites used only visual assessment, and for the quantitative assessment the most used was quantification by region of interest.
Conclusions
These results reflect the clinical activity of 2013 and first quarter of 2014.
The main indications of the studies were <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> and <dis>movement disorders</dis>.
Variability in the evaluation of the studies is among the challenges that will be faced in the coming years.Abstract

 Lesch-Nyhan disease is a rare genetic disease characterized by a deficiency in the function of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT).
Patients affected by this disease experience hyperuricemia, <dis>motor disorders</dis>, <dis>mental retardation</dis> and, in the most severe cases, self-mutilation.
Its clinical manifestations depend on the enzymatic activity of HGPRT, which is classically linked to the type of alteration in the HGPRT gene.
More than 400 mutations of this gene have been found.
At present, one of the controversial aspects of the disease is the relationship between the genotype and phenotype; cases have been described lacking a mutation, such as the patient presented in this article, as well as families who despite sharing the same genetic defect show disorders with differing severity.
Epigenetic processes, which modify the genetic expression without changing the sequence of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), could explain the clinical variability observed in this disease.Abstract
 Rett Syndrome (RS) is a neurological disorder that almost exclusively affects females.
RS is characterized by <dis>severe mental retardation</dis> following a period of apparent normal development in early childhood.
The main clinical features include <dis>autism</dis>, spasticity, microcephaly, scoliosis, stereotyping, abnormal respiratory control and seizures.
Patients with RS have been reported to be extremely sensitive to sedatives and exhibit a slow recovery from anesthesia.
We describe and discuss the anesthetic management of a 26-year-old woman with RS and distal fracture of the humerus that underwent reduction and fixation with Kirschner's wires under regional anesthesia and sedation.
Intraoperatively, the patient experienced respiratory depression following the administration of 1 mg of I.V.
midazolam.
Our experience in this case led us to conclude and suggest that benzodiazepines should not be used in RS and in the absence of contraindications the technique of choice should be regional anesthesia.Abstract
 Fragile X syndrome is an inherited form of <dis>mental retardation</dis> with a connective tissue component involving mitral valve prolapse.
The most frequent manifestations of fragile X syndrome are <dis>learning disability</dis>, orofacial morphological alterations and macroorchidism.
The usefulness of advanced haemodynamic monitoring for goal-directed therapy is increasingly high during neurosurgical procedures.
Non-invasive cardiac output monitoring may be considered as a new alternative for emergency neurosurgical procedures.
Our aim was to detect haemodynamic changes in a syndromic fragile X patient, given the usual concomitant presentation of cardiovascular disease, such as mitral valve prolapse and dilated aortic root, in an attempt at obtaining the best intraoperative and postoperative neurological outcomes without worsening cardiovascular function, by means of individualized intra-operative goal directed therapy.
This type of non-invasive monitoring allows surgery to proceed without delay and provides excellent information of the haemodynamic status.
This syndrome is relevant due to its anaesthetic implications and the paucity of cases published to date.Abstract
 Prader–Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hypotonia, obesity, short stature, <dis>mental retardation</dis>, hyperphagia, hypogonadism and low life expectancy.
We describe the case of a 31-year-old female patient with Prader–Willi syndrome scheduled for bariatric surgery.
Anesthetic considerations are reviewed highlighting perioperative complications associated with this syndrome.Abstract
 Background
Cigarette smoking is a modifiable risk factor for <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>, while the relationship between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> is not fully understood.
The objectives were to identify a possible association between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> depending on age in the Chinese rural population.
Methods
Data for the study consisted of 1782 participants (40 years and older) who lived in a rural village in the vicinity of Xi’an, China.
Data about smoking history and cognitive function were collected.
Cognitive function was scored by the Mini-Mental State Examination.
The effect of age on the relationship between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> was analyzed with interaction and stratified analysis by logistic regression models.
Results
Interaction analysis showed that current smoking is positively related with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (odds ratio [OR] = 9.067; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.305–62.979; _P_ = 0.026).
However, the interaction term, age by current smoking, is negatively related with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (OR = 0.969; 95%CI 0.939–0.999; _P_ = 0.045).
Stratified logistic regression showed that in the 40–65 years of age sublayer, OR of current smoking is 1.966 ( _P_ = 0.044), whereas in the >65 years of age sublayer, the OR is 0.470 ( _P_ = 0.130).
This means that the association between current smoking and <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> with age might be positive (OR > 1) in lower age sublayers, but no significant difference in higher age sublayers.
Conclusions
In conclusion, current smoking might be positively associated with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> in the middle-aged but the relationship declines with increasing age.Abstract
 Background and objective
Functional assessment is especially relevant in patients with <dis>cognitive impairment</dis> (<dis>CI</dis>).
The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale assesses functional ability and its use is becoming increasingly popular.
This study aims to perform the translation and cultural adaptation of the DAD scale in order to create a Spanish version: DAD-E.
Patients and method
A double translation/back-translation process was developed, as well as a pilot study with 14 caregivers of patients with <dis>CI</dis>, and 3 review meetings to achieve general agreement.
Results
The DAD-E includes the 40 original items.
Four response options and 8 scores were added in order to detect <dis>functional disability</dis> induced by <dis>CI</dis> independently of other possible causes.
More detailed instructions for administration and scoring of the scale have been provided in order to improve the reliability of the content.
Conclusions
The DAD-E was shown to be a cultural and linguistic adaptation equivalent of the original scale, which allows it to be applied to the Spanish population.
It may be a useful instrument in clinical practice since it provides a more accurate assessment of <dis>functional disability</dis> due to <dis>cognitive impairment</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is produced by mutations in genes that encode regulatory or structural proteins of the cohesin complex.
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is not a major criterion of the disease, but it affects many individuals.
The objective of this study was to study the incidence and type of CHD in patients with CdLS.
Material and method
Cardiological findings were evaluated in 149 patients with CdLS and their possible relationship with clinical and genetic variables.
Results
A percentage of 34.9 had CHD (septal defects 50%, pulmonary stenosis 27%, aortic coarctation 9.6%).
The presence of CHD was related with neonatal hospitalization ( _p_ = 0.04), <dis>hearing loss</dis> ( _p_ = 0.002), mortality ( _p_ = 0.09) and lower <dis>hyperactivity</dis> ( _p_ = 0.02), it being more frequent in _HDAC8_ \+ patients (60%), followed by _NIPBL_ \+ (33%) and _SMC1A_ \+ (28.5%).
While septal defects predominate in _NIPBL_ +, pulmonary stenosis is more common in _HDAC8_ +.
Conclusions
Patients with CdLS have a high incidence of CHD, which varies according to the affected gene, the most frequent findings being septal defects and pulmonary stenosis.
Perform a cardiologic study in all these patients is suggested.Abstract
 Background
The rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical entity capable to cause <dis>hearing impairment</dis> that can be diagnosed promptly with high frequencies audiometry.
Objective
To detect <dis>subclinical sensorineural hearing loss</dis> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Material and methods
Cross-sectional study on patients with rheumatoid arthritis performing high frequency audiometry 125 Hz to 16,000 Hz and tympanometry.
The results were correlated with markers of disease activity and response to therapy.
Results
High frequency audiometry was performed in 117 female patients aged from 19 to 65 years.
<dis>Sensorineural hearing loss</dis> was observed at a sensitivity of pure tones from 125 to 8000 Hz in 43.59%, a tone threshold of 10,000 to 16,000 Hz in 94.02% patients in the right ear and in 95.73% in the left ear.
Hearing was normal in 8 (6.84%) patients.
<dis>Hearing loss</dis> was observed in 109 (93.16%), and was asymmetric in 36 (30.77%), symmetric in 73 (62.37%), bilateral in 107 (91.45%), unilateral in 2 (1.71%), and no conduction and/or <dis>mixed hearing loss</dis> was encountered.
Eight (6.83%) patients presented vertigo, 24 (20.51%) tinnitus.
Tympanogram type A presented in 88.90% in the right ear and 91.46% in the left ear, with 5.98–10.25% type As.
Stapedius reflex was present in 75.3–85.2%.
Speech discrimination in the left ear was significantly different ( _p_ = 0.02) in the group older than 50 years.
No association was found regarding markers of disease activity, but there was an association with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis disease.
Conclusions
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had a high prevalence of <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> for high and very high frequencies.Abstract
 Background
Primary empty sella is a herniation of the sellar diaphragm into the pituitary space.
It is an incidental finding and patients may manifest neurological, ophthalmological and/or endocrine disorders.
Episodes of vertigo, dizziness, and <dis>hearing loss</dis>, have been reported.
Objective
To determine the conditional probability, as well as the statistical dependency, through the Bayesian analysis in patients with primary empty sella and audiovestibular disorders.
Patients
Individuals who attended the National Rehabilitation Institute from January 2010 to December 2011, diagnosed with primary empty sella and audiovestibular disorders.
Material and methods
An analysis was performed on a sample of 18 patients with a diagnosis of primary empty sella confirmed with magnetic resonance studies and who had signs of vertigo, <dis>hearing loss</dis> and dizziness.
Results
Of the 18 patients studied, 3 (16.66%) had primary empty sella as the only clinical evidence.
In 9 patients (50%) empty sella was associated with vertigo, and 16 patients (88.88%) were diagnosed with <dis>hearing loss</dis>, with <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis> being the most frequent (77.77%).
The intersection between the proportions of primary empty sella with the presence and type of <dis>hearing loss</dis> was calculated.
Thus for <dis>sensorineural hearing loss</dis>, the calculated ratio was _P_ ( _AB_ ) = 0.6912, and for <dis>conductive and mixed hearing loss</dis> the value of _P_ ( _AB_ ) = 0.0493 in both cases.
Conclusions
Bayesian analysis and conditional probability enables the dependence between two or more variables to be calculated.
In this study both mathematical models were used to analyse comorbidities and audiovestibular disorders in patients diagnosed with primary empty sella.Background.
Orbital cellulitis is an infectious disease that is very common in pediatric patients, in which severe complications may develop. 
Etiological agents related to this disease are Haemophilus influenzae B, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 95% of the cases. 
Streptococcus beta-hemolytic and anaerobic microorganisms may also be present and cause <5% of the cases. 
We present an uncommon case of orbital cellulitis complicated by a subperiosteal abscess caused Streptococcus pyogenes.

Case Report.
A 9-year-old male patient with a history of <dis>attention deficit disorder</dis> and <dis>hyperactivity disorder</dis> since he was five years old. 
His illness started with erythema on the outer edge of the right eye, increase in the peri-orbicular volume with limitation of eyelid opening, progression to proptosis, pain with eye movements and conjunctival purulent discharge. 
Image studies reported a subperiosteal and pre-septal right abscess with extraocular cellulitis. 
Empirical antibiotic treatment was started, surgical drainage was performed, and Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the culture of the obtained purulent material.

Conclusions.
Due to the implementation of vaccination schemes against H. influenza and S. pneumoniae since the 90s, the cases by these pathogens have decreased, causing new bacteria to take place as the cause of the infection. 
The importance of considering S. pyogenes as an etiology of orbital cellulitis comes from its rapid progression to abscess formation, and the few cases described in the literature.
Abstract
 <dis>Deafblindness</dis> is a disability resulting from the combination of <dis>visual and auditory sensory impairments</dis>, which can manifest in different levels causing <dis>special communication problems</dis>.
<dis>Deafblind</dis> people have special needs that derive from <dis>difficulties in sensing, understanding, attention</dis> and a <dis>lack of the skills required to function effectively in society</dis>.
<dis>Deafblindness</dis> requires specialised services, personnel specifically trained in its care and special methods for communication.
Objective
The main objective of this study is to explore the experiences of <dis>deafblind</dis> people in relation to health care throughout their lives.
This study was developed at the St. Ángela de la Cruz Centre, belonging to the Association of Parents of Deafblind People in Spain.
Method
Phenomenological qualitative study, through semi-structured interviews with <dis>deafblind</dis> people at the St. Ángela de la Cruz Centre, Salteras (Seville), carried out in 2015, with the help of interpreters in Spanish sign language.
Topics covered in the interviews refer to facilities, human resources, time waiting and health care.
Results
Coinciding statements were obtained, where the participants point out architectural and educational barriers in health care and stand out better if the professionals know sign language.
Conclusions
It can be highlighted that healthcare professionals lack knowledge of all aspects of <dis>deafblindness</dis>, sign language in particular, and there is a shortage of signs and information for the <dis>deafblind</dis>.
Moreover, alternatives are required to reduce waiting times and improve direct communication with health professionals.Clinical depression is a <dis>mental disorder</dis> that often results in emotion dysregulation. 
This affective instability is one of the central issues of depression and is observed through a significant number of symptoms and behaviours, including suicide. 
Emotion dysregulation is a trans-diagnostic dimension that requires psychological intervention to provide skills that help the depressed individual to regulate their negative emotional responses. 
Currently, there is growing scientific evidence in the literature indicating that positive emotions can buffer against the negative effects of emotion dysregulation in clinical depression through the practice of mindfulness. 
Mindfulness based cognitive therapy is an intervention for people who are at risk of experiencing depressive relapses. 
This model of intervention helps participants to develop awareness of their experience in the present time, a reduction of self-judgement, and an increase of acceptance and self-compassion, as well as the self-regulation of their care. 
The purpose of this article is to review the conceptual model of emotion regulation of depression, based on the practice of mindfulness. 
The current review explores the role of mindfulness in the emotion regulation of clinical depression, based on the scientific literature available. 
Based on our research experience and the reports of several other laboratories, we examined the modes of actions and how the practice of mindfulness and positive emotions contribute to the ability for depressed individuals to recover from negative emotions.
Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a prevalent, disabling syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and symptoms such as <dis>sleep disturbance</dis>, fatigue, stiffness, distress, <dis>cognitive impairments</dis> and a high comorbidity with anxiety and depressive disorders. 
Although no curative treatment has yet been found, various therapeutic approaches have been developed in the fields of pharmacology and psychology. 
The present paper aims to offer a narrative review and a description for clinicians and researchers of psychological therapies that have been applied in a format group in FMS with strong or promising empirical support: i.e., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Psychoeducational program for FMS (FibroQoL), Amygdala Retraining Therapy (ART), and Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (ABCT). 
This review will offer a brief practical summary of each therapy protocol (session-by-session), their rationale and available evidence of their effectiveness.Abstract
 Objective
Previous research supports the relationship between the use of alcohol and other drugs and <dis>mental disorders</dis>.
The aim of this study was to analyse the association between drug and alcohol use prior to incarceration and the current prevalence of <dis>mental disorders</dis> among the incarcerated population in Spain.
Material and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted, including to 2709 incarcerated subjects (2484 males and 225 females) from a total of 8 prisons.
A self-administered anonymous and voluntary questionnaire was used.
The prevalence of psychoactive substance use prior to imprisonment and the current prevalence of <dis>mental disorders</dis> was calculated.
The association between the two variables was analysed with logistic regression for both genders.
Results
Alcohol was the most consumed substance in the 6 months prior to detention for both men and women (68.5 and 48.9%, respectively) followed by cannabis (50.9 and 38.2%, respectively).
The prevalence of <dis>mental disorders</dis> in prison was statically significant for men and women (24.9 and 34.2%, respectively).
Most of the psychoactive substances analysed involve a risk factor for current <dis>mental disorder</dis>, especially as regards the use of psychotropic drugs (OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.54–2.71) and cannabis (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47–2.24).
Discussion
We found an association between alcohol and drug use and the current prevalence of <dis>mental disorders</dis> among the incarcerated population sample.
Furthermore, it is recommended to develop effective protocols for treatment and rehabilitation programmes in prison.
These should suit inmates’ history of drug and alcohol use to improve mental health strategies.Introduction
Individuals with <dis>dementia</dis> suffer from changes at a cognitive, emotional, and behavioural level. 
These changes can also affect the quality of life of their caregivers in a physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension.
Objective
Determine the perception of life quality, taking into account the burden of caregivers of patients with <dis>dementia</dis>.
Method
A descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study was conducted on an intentional sample of 50 caregivers of patients diagnosed with <dis>dementia</dis>. 
The information was collected using three tools: socio-demographic variables, quality of life, and dimension of caregiver's burden.
Results
The sample consisted of 80% women, with an age range of 36–59 years, of whom 54% were married. 
More than three-quarters (78%) of them had been a caregiver for more than 37 months, and 66% dedicated 24h to the work of caring. 
The main caregivers experience a low care burden and low effect on their quality of life.
Conclusions
The study shows the presence of women in the role of caregivers, the relationship between the quality life and burden, and how they are influenced by the physical and psychological dimensions. 
Similarly, a low social well-being negatively influences the quality life.Abstract
 Introduction
<dis>Mental illness</dis> has been associated with violent behaviour.
Criminal behaviour in the mentally ill population in Colombia has not been well studied.
Methods
This is a retrospective, descriptive study, from a secondary source.
An analysis was made of the sociodemographic, clinical, and legal variables of 127 unfit to plead patients.
A descriptive analysis of quantitative variables was performed by measures of central tendency, and frequencies and percentages were calculated for the qualitative variables.
The software SPSS® version 21.0 was used to analyse the data, and the study was approved by the Research Committee of the CES University.
Results
The median age was 34 years, interquartile range 19 years, and 92.1% were men.
The primary diagnosis was schizophrenia in 63%, 66.9% consumed alcohol, and 58.3% other drugs at the time they committed the crime.
Almost one/third (29.1%) had a criminal record, and the most common type of crime was murder in 44.1% of cases.
Around half (50.3%) of the victims had some degree of consanguinity with the patient.
Discussion
The study subjects had higher illiteracy and lower educational levels than the Colombian prison population.
Schizophrenia was the main diagnosis, and homicide the most prevalent crime, which agrees with the literature where non- indictable patients are responsible for 5–20% of murder cases worldwide.
Conclusions
To reduce the gap between the diagnosis and treatment of <dis>mental disorders</dis>, especially schizophrenia, should be within the specific actions to prevent violence and criminal behaviour associated with <dis>mental illness</dis>.Abstract
 Introduction
Hypothyroidism results from inadequate production of thyroid hormone.
It is known that there is a relationship between the <dis>major psychiatric disorders</dis> and hypothyroidism.
Objective
To determine the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients admitted due to <dis>major psychiatric disorders</dis> in Montserrat Hospital during the period from March to October 2010.
Material and methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 patients admitted to Montserrat Hospital with a primary diagnosis of <dis>major psychiatric disorder</dis> (major depression, bipolar affective disorder, generalised panic disorder, panic disorder, mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, and schizophrenia) in the aforementioned period.
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was performed to assess the evidence of hypothyroidism.
Results
The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism was found to be 10.5% (95%CI, 5–16%).
It was 12.5% in anxiety disorder, 11.1% in depressive disorder, with a lower prevalence of 10.3% for bipolar disorder, and 9.9% for schizophrenia.
Conclusions
The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism was found to be less than in the general population, which is between 4.64% and 18.5%, and hypothyroidism was found in disorders other than depression.In this research, it is presented an intervention program that combines storytelling with morphosyntactic activities to improve grammatical skills in pupils with <dis>Specific Language Impairment</dis> (<dis>SLI</dis>). 
The sample consisted of a total of 34 pupils diagnosed with <dis>SLI</dis> and 34 children with typical language development. 
For the selection of the sample, the CELF-3 test, the Peabody test, the Hearing Association and Visual Association subtests of the ITPA and the K-BIT Intelligence test were used. 
The intervention program consisted of 216 sessions of 40minutes each, in which oral narrative activities were combined with other activities related to the automation of morphosyntactic skills. 
Significant gains were also made in the group of children with <dis>SLI</dis> versus controls in total ungrammaticality, ungrammatical sentences, morphological and syntactical errors. 
In conclusion, a combined program of both storytelling and morphosyntactic skills improves grammatical achievement in pupils with <dis>SLI</dis>.
